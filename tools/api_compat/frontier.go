//
// This file answers "what is left, and why" as a MEASUREMENT rather than as
// prose. Every type the strict verifier reports missing must appear in exactly
// one family below, and every family must carry a classification. A missing
// type nobody has classified is UNREVIEWED, and UNREVIEWED is a defect: it is
// the difference between "we decided not to do this yet, for this reason" and
// "nobody looked".
//
// The registry exists because ROADMAP.md used to carry these counts by hand,
// and a hand-written count drifts the moment a milestone lands. ROADMAP.md's
// scoreboard and family table are now validated against this registry and
// against docs/generated/api-compat-report.json, and docs/generated/
// remaining-work.md is generated from it.

Foundation 99 held the dispatcher to be XNA's Games for Windows LIVE proxy and said none of CNA's routes is that dispatcher -- but CNA declares cna_gamer_services_dispatcher_{set_window_handle,subscribe_installing_title_update_ext,initialize,update} (present since 0.21), and a probe (cna/build-probe/qual-probes/go-dispatcher.c) measured all four succeeding on the HEADLESS artifact with no account service configured: a local offline profile, the window handle round-tripping, and a second Initialize refused with CNA result 3. Nothing external blocks the type any more. What remains is local design: GamerServicesComponent lives in its own namespace, so its private GameComponent base would be the first COMPOSED base held across a package boundary (GameComponent's derived-binding hook is unexported), and IUpdateable::Update is projected infallible while the dispatcher's Update can fail.
