	// a path or a query.

	// reference body is NOT a field read: get_IsActive is 30 bytes that consult
	// GamerServicesDispatcher.IsInitialized and Guide.IsVisible before reading

// Foundation 58 — CLR base substitutability at a Go parameter position.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// substitutableBases are the CLR classes whose PARAMETER positions accept a
// derived value, and therefore project to a reference interface rather than to
// the concrete pointer.
//
// # Why a parameter position and nothing else
//
// In C# a parameter typed `Texture2D` accepts a `RenderTarget2D`, because
// RenderTarget2D IS-A Texture2D. Go has no such relation and CNA-Go refuses to
// fake one with embedding, so a `*Texture2D` parameter would be a position no
// derived value can reach -- and there are SEVEN of them, all
// SpriteBatch.Draw's `texture`.
//
// A RETURN keeps the concrete type. `Texture2D::FromStream` returns a Texture2D
// and a caller uses every Texture2D member on it; returning an interface would
// take those members away to solve a problem returns do not have. The same
// holds for a property getter, whose value is read rather than supplied.
//
// # The mechanism
//
// One exported interface per base, `<GoName>Reference`, with an UNEXPORTED
// method. Exported so a consumer can name the parameter type; unexported method
// so only this module can satisfy it -- a consumer cannot hand SpriteBatch an
// object CNA never made.
//
// The forbidden-accessor rule is untouched. There is still no public Base,
// Parent or AsTexture2D: the interface is a position's type, not a conversion a
// consumer performs, and a call site reads exactly as the C# one does.
//
// # It is registered, not inferred
//
// A base enters this table only when the substitutability measurement reports
// its requirement as LIVE -- positions on projected carriers AND at least one
// projected derived type. measureXNABaseSubstitutability cross-checks the two,
// so a base that stops being live, or one that becomes live and is not
// recorded, is a diagnostic rather than a silent signature.

	//

	// -- whose RETURNS widen, and it is recorded in returnWideningBases for
	// that. The reason is measured rather than stylistic: Clone is declared to
	// return Effect and every stock effect OVERRIDES it to return an instance

//
// # Why this has to be measured before any design is chosen
//
// Foundation 33 recorded twelve XNA-to-XNA base relationships and 41 derived
// types and stopped. The obvious next move is to pick a composition rule, and
// the obvious worry is that private composition cannot express CLR
// substitutability: in CLR, a DrawableGameComponent may be passed anywhere a
// GameComponent is named, and a Go struct holding a private *GameComponent
// cannot.
//
// But that worry is only real where the profile actually NAMES a base class in
// a public signature. If nothing in the whole contract takes or returns a
// GameComponent, then no consumer can ever need a DrawableGameComponent to
// stand in for one, and private composition with explicit forwarding is not a
// compromise -- it is exactly sufficient.
//
// So the question is answered by counting, not by argument. This walks every
// public member of every type in the profile and records every position -- a
// parameter, a return, a property type, a field type, or a generic argument --
// whose CLR type names a class that another class in the SAME profile derives

// The composition rule, stated once and measured everywhere.

// An XNA class that inherits another XNA class projects the base as PRIVATE
// NAMED COMPOSITION plus EXPLICIT MEASURED FORWARDING:
//
//	type DrawableGameComponent struct {
//	    base *GameComponent          // private, named, not embedded
//	    ...                          // the derived type's own state
//	}
//
// and never as Go embedding:
//
//	type DrawableGameComponent struct {
//	    *GameComponent               // REFUSED: BASE_MAPPING_MISMATCH
//	}
//
// Three reasons, in order of weight.
//
// Embedding is not inheritance. It promotes the base's method set wholesale,
// including members the derived class OVERRIDES or HIDES, and the promoted
// method would silently win wherever the derived one was not redeclared with
// exactly the right shape. Explicit forwarding makes every inherited member a
// declared, measured member of the derived type, so the override set is a fact
// the verifier can check rather than a property of Go's promotion rules.
//
// Embedding also publishes the base. An exported embedded field is public
// surface Microsoft never declared, and it hands a consumer a way to reach the
// base object and mutate it behind the derived type's back. There is no public
// Base, Parent or AsGameComponent member either, for the same reason: the
// pinned contract declares none, and a signature-projection requirement is the
// only thing that could justify one.
//
// And it is sufficient. Foundation 40 measured the actual CLR substitutability
// requirement of the whole profile: GameComponent, GraphicsResource and
// MathTypeConverter -- 25 of the 41 derived types between them -- are named in
// ZERO public signature positions, and no family is live. Private composition
// is not a compromise for such a family; there is no position in the contract
// for a derived value to flow through.

// mapInheritedXNABaseMembers synthesizes the XNA_INHERITED provenance class:
// the public members a derived XNA class inherits from an XNA base whose
// relationship is COMPOSED, transitively, minus the ones the derived class
// declares itself.
//
// # Why "minus the ones it declares itself"
//
// A derived class that redeclares an inherited member is overriding or hiding
// it, and the projected member is then the DERIVED one -- its own body, its own
// provenance, its own fallibility. Counting it twice would inflate the member
// accounting and would claim a forwarding that must not exist.
//
// # The exclusion is by CLR SIGNATURE, not by name
//
// It used to be by name and kind, on the recorded claim that "no derived type
// in the contract overloads an inherited name". Milestone 55 measured that
// claim and it is false, on the one composed family that already existed:
//
//	GameComponent        declares public Dispose() and protected Dispose(bool)
//	DrawableGameComponent declares          protected Dispose(bool)  -- an OVERRIDE
//
// The derived declaration is an override of the PROTECTED overload, which is
// not public surface and is never inherited. The PUBLIC Dispose() is a
// different slot that the derived class does not touch, so it is inherited --
// and a name-keyed exclusion dropped it, silently deleting a public member from
// DrawableGameComponent's projected surface. The same shape recurs on every
// GraphicsResource descendant, each of which overrides Dispose(bool) and
// inherits Dispose().
//
// The key is therefore the CLR slot identity: kind, name, and for methods the
// parameter type list. That is exactly what the runtime uses to decide whether
// a derived declaration occupies an inherited member's slot.
//
// # The overload namespace is shared with the derived type's own members
//
// Once an inherited public member can share a name with a declared one, the two
// are one overload group and the settled overload rule applies to the group as
// a whole: every member of a group of more than one carries By<ParameterShape>.
// DrawableGameComponent's pair therefore spells DisposeByNone and
// DisposeByBoolean -- the same two names GameComponent itself takes, which is
// the point: an inherited member must not be renamed by being inherited.
//
// That is why the caller resolves the inherited set first and passes ONE
// overload-group map through both mappings.
//
// # Transitivity
//
// The walk follows the base chain as far as COMPOSED relationships go, so a
// three-deep family projects the whole inherited surface rather than one level
// of it. It stops at the first base that is not an XNA class in the profile,
// which is where the BCL-inherited provenance class takes over.

// imports it. The relocation rule handles a CLASS member by moving it; an
// INTERFACE member has nowhere to move to.
//
// The conformance is therefore carried by a named adapter in the interface's
// own package, which wraps the class. That is not a workaround invented here:
// it is what the projection already does, and it is what a consumer resolving
// the service out of the game's service container actually receives. The

// named carrier really does satisfy the interface -- rather than the class's
