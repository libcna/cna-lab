// The native game-event bridge is the first CNA-Go surface whose correctness
// depends on values the compiler cannot infer from a Go signature: an event
// identity, a registration-handle width, a callback shape and the position of
// the caller context in a five-parameter prototype. Each of those is pinned by
// a _Static_assert or an incompatible-pointer-types assignment, and each of the
// mutations below removes exactly one pin and requires the compile to fail.
//
// The mutations act on real source. Two translation units carry the pins:
//
//   - internal/interop/bridge.c compiled with CNA-Go's private manifest and no
//     canonical CNA header, which is exactly how the cgo build sees it;
//   - tools/native_abi/testdata/probe.c compiled WITH the canonical header,
//     which is the only place the private manifest and the canonical
//     declarations are compiled together.
//
// A mutation that still compiles is a hole in the ABI evidence, not a passing
// test.
