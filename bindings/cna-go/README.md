CNA-Go maps Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0 namespaces to Go import paths and
executes native-backed APIs only through CNA's canonical C ABI:

```text
Go game
   ↓
Microsoft/Xna/Framework[/Audio|Content|Design|Graphics|Graphics/PackedVector|
                        Input|Input/Touch|Media|Storage]
   ↓
internal/interop (the only cgo/native boundary)
   ↓
CNA C ABI 0.35.0
```

There is deliberately no invented public `CNA/Framework` layer. Pure XNA
values are implemented as Go values; public packages expose neither C types
nor native handles.

## What is qualified

The structural scoreboard maps the authoritative XNA 4.0 Windows runtime
profile (257 types and 2,964 members) onto expected Go types and members, and
every count in it is generated rather than restated here — the current values
are in
[docs/generated/api-compat-report.json](docs/generated/api-compat-report.json)
and
[docs/generated/missing-type-inventory.md](docs/generated/missing-type-inventory.md).
The strict verifier stays red for exactly one diagnostic -- the unprojected
`GamerServicesComponent`, classified `ACTIONABLE_LOCAL` in
[docs/generated/remaining-work.md](docs/generated/remaining-work.md); every
mismatch, leak, allowlist, and unmeasured-category gate is green, and
`UNEXPECTED_TYPE`, `UNEXPECTED_MEMBER` and `ABI_MISMATCHES` are zero.

The runtime evidence is `tools/native_stress`, 21 scenarios × 20 isolated
cycles, green on two CNA 0.35.0 artifacts: HEADLESS and OPENGLES3 on a real GPU
inside a private compositor, where it includes back-buffer pixel checks
(`docs/generated/native-stress-report*.json`).

The paragraphs below are the milestone record of Foundations 1 to 42, written
when each landed; where one says a surface is missing, a later foundation
added it (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for Foundations 43 to 99 and the
0.35.0 requalification).

Some missing types inherit from another type in the profile whose base
relationship is still deferred. They are recorded with classified blockers
rather than left silent. Foundation 41 settled the inheritance architecture —
private named composition with explicit measured forwarding — so a deferred
base is now a per-family decision rather than one global blocker, and
`DrawableGameComponent` and the whole `GraphicsResource` chain are projected
through it.

Foundation 1 qualifies on **Linux amd64 desktop with cgo**:

- real CNA-driven `Game` lifecycle and tick-exact `GameTime`;
- locked owner OS thread, generation checks, `runtime/cgo.Handle` callbacks,
  and contained callback errors/panics;
- real GraphicsDeviceManager/device, native viewport and clear;
- PNG `Texture2D` creation from `io.Reader`;
- all seven `SpriteBatch.Draw` overloads, over BOTH real CNA submission routes:
  the four position overloads reach `cna_sprite_batch_submit_scaled_many` and
  the three destination-rectangle overloads reach `cna_sprite_batch_submit_many`,
  inside a begin/end pair whose three guards carry Microsoft's own messages;
- native keyboard snapshots with exact XNA `Keys` values;
- a complete first managed closure measured by the verifier and behavior
  corpus.

Foundation 2 additionally qualifies, as managed Go with no ABI expansion:

- complete `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4`, `Quaternion`, and `Matrix` values;
- the recursive `Plane`, `Ray`, bounding box/sphere/frustum, and containment
  dependency closure;
- explicit nullable `(value, hasValue)` intersection results;
- complete `Color`, including its 141 predefined static colors;
- managed `Viewport.Project` and `Viewport.Unproject`;
- a 93-observation PURE_XNA_DERIVED exact-bit behavior corpus.

Foundation 3 qualifies the complete managed Curve family with no ABI expansion:

- reference-class identity for `Curve`, `CurveKey`, and `CurveKeyCollection`;
- exact key constructors, equality, hash, clone, and `Single.CompareTo` order;
- sorted reference collection semantics, shallow clone, mapped index failures,
  and versioned fail-fast iteration;
- XNA binary32 tangents, Hermite/Step evaluation, all five loop modes, and
  negative-cycle behavior;
- a 142-observation `PURE_XNA_DERIVED` corpus with zero failures.

Foundation 4 qualifies the complete managed PackedVector family with no ABI
expansion:

- both managed interfaces, including general `!0 -> TPacked` substitution and
  `IPackedVectorOfTPacked[TPacked]` generic identity;
- exact pointer-method-set conformance for all seventeen mutable value structs;
- 25 formally measured explicit-interface witness methods without member-count
  inflation or allowlists;
- XNA-exact UNorm, SNorm, raw byte/short, and non-IEEE half packing behavior;
- 262,400 exhaustive packed-pattern round trips and a 201-observation
  `PURE_XNA_DERIVED` corpus with zero failures.

Foundation 5 qualifies the complete managed vertex-element descriptor closure
with no ABI expansion:

- `VertexElementFormat` and `VertexElementUsage` as exact non-flags `int32`
  enums, including undefined CLR enum values;
- `VertexElement` as a private-state Go value struct with exact mutable-property
  projection, zero-value and copy semantics;
- only `Equals(Object)`—no invented typed equality overload—and both exact
  mapped operator identities;
- XNA `SmartGetHashCode` word-XOR/fallback behavior and exact descriptor string
  formatting;
- a 227-observation `PURE_XNA_DERIVED` corpus with zero failures.

Foundation 6 completes the root PlayerIndex enum and Keyboard surface without
ABI expansion:

- exact non-flags `int32` values `One=0`, `Two=1`, `Three=2`, and `Four=3`;
- arbitrary raw enum values remain representable and are never validated;
- `KeyboardGetStateByPlayerIndex(framework.PlayerIndex)` uses the same process
  keyboard route and runtime/error requirements as `KeyboardGetStateByNone`;
- direct XNA IL proves the player argument is never read;
- Keyboard moves from partial to complete, with a 234-observation corpus and
  zero failures.

Foundation 7 completes DisplayOrientation and one exact managed
GraphicsDeviceManager property slice without ABI expansion:

- `[Flags]` `DisplayOrientation` uses exact explicit `int32` values 0, 1, 2,
  and 4 while preserving combinations and unknown raw bits;
- `SupportedOrientations()` and `SetSupportedOrientations(DisplayOrientation)`
  store managed configuration with no synthetic error or native call;
- direct XNA IL proves constructor defaults and that every setter stores the
  exact value and marks private device state dirty, including same-value sets;
- GraphicsDeviceManager remains partial with 40 missing members, and the
  managed corpus reaches 242 observations with zero failures.

Foundation 8 completes exactly the managed Graphics `BufferUsage` enum without
ABI expansion:

- exact `[Flags]` named-`int32` metadata with explicit `None=0` and
  `WriteOnly=1` constants;
- the synthetic CLR `value__` field is excluded, leaving exactly two mapped Go
  identities;
- zero value, arbitrary signed raw bits, and typed bitwise composition remain
  available without validation or helper API;
- no buffer type, buffer operation, GraphicsDevice member, or GPU capability is
  added, and the corpus reaches 247 observations with zero failures.

Foundation 9 completes exactly the managed Graphics `ClearOptions` enum
without ABI expansion:

- exact `[Flags]` named-`int32` metadata with explicit `Target=1`,
  `DepthBuffer=2`, and `Stencil=4` constants;
- the synthetic CLR `value__` field is excluded, leaving exactly three mapped
  Go identities;
- XNA declares no named zero member, so raw zero remains representable but
  unnamed—there is no invented `None`, `Default`, or `All` constant;
- combinations, unknown bits, negative values, OR, and AND remain available
  without validation or helper API;
- no GraphicsDevice.Clear overload or native clear behavior is added, and the
  corpus reaches 256 observations with zero failures.

Foundation 10 completes exactly the managed Graphics `SurfaceFormat` enum
contract without ABI expansion:

- exact non-flags named-`int32` metadata with all 20 explicit literals from
  `Color=0` through `HdrBlendable=19`;
- the synthetic CLR `value__` field is excluded, so the pinned contract's 21
  field identities map to exactly 20 Go identities;
- zero value equals `Color`, while arbitrary positive and negative raw values
  remain representable without validation;
- no `iota`, flags marker, Stringer/helper surface, or PackedVector dependency
  is added;
- no pixel-format support, texture/render-target consumer, GPU/native format
  mapping, or CNA ABI route is claimed, and the corpus reaches 262 observations
  with zero failures.

Foundation 11 completes exactly the managed Graphics `DepthFormat` enum
contract without ABI expansion:

- exact non-flags named-`int32` metadata with `None=0`, `Depth16=1`,
  `Depth24=2`, and `Depth24Stencil8=3`;
- the synthetic CLR `value__` field is excluded, so five source identities
  map to exactly four Go identities;
- zero value equals `None`, while arbitrary positive and negative raw values
  remain representable without validation;
- no `iota`, flags marker, Stringer/helper surface, SurfaceFormat conversion,
  consumer API, GPU/native depth format mapping, or CNA ABI route is added;
- no actual depth/stencil surface support is claimed, and the corpus reaches
  268 observations with zero failures.

Foundation 12 completes exactly the managed Graphics `GraphicsProfile` enum
contract without ABI expansion:

- exact non-flags named-`int32` metadata with `Reach=0` and `HiDef=1`;
- the synthetic CLR `value__` field is excluded, so three source identities map
  to exactly two Go identities;
- zero value equals `Reach`, while arbitrary positive and negative raw values
  remain representable without validation;
- no `iota`, flags marker, Stringer/helper surface, consumer API, GPU/native
  profile mapping, or CNA ABI route is added;
- `Reach` and `HiDef` are metadata values, not hardware capability claims: no
  profile selection, feature-level detection, or renderer support is claimed,
  and the corpus reaches 274 observations with zero failures.

Foundation 13 completes exactly the managed Input `ButtonState` enum contract
without ABI expansion:

- exact non-flags named-`int32` metadata with `Released=0` and `Pressed=1`;
- the synthetic CLR `value__` field is excluded, so three source identities map
  to exactly two Go identities;
- zero value equals `Released`, while arbitrary positive and negative raw
  values remain representable without validation;
- no `iota`, flags marker, Stringer/helper surface, consumer API, input backend
  or native enum mapping, or CNA ABI route is added;
- `Released` and `Pressed` are metadata values, not hardware capability claims:
  no mouse, gamepad, D-pad, or button-polling behavior is claimed, and the
  corpus reaches 280 observations with zero failures.

See [Foundation 14 pure-managed batch A evidence](docs/foundation-14-pure-managed-batch-evidence.md)
for the 25 completed enums and their 121 mapped identities, the per-type pinned
raw tables and deferred reverse consumers, the table-driven verifier closure
category, the 304 exhaustive negative cases, the ranked skip list with exact
reasons, and the strict no-capability-inflation boundary for the new `Audio`,
`Media`, and `Input/Touch` namespaces.

See [Foundation 15 pure-managed batch B evidence](docs/foundation-15-pure-managed-batch-evidence.md)
for the last five leaf enums, the GamePad/Mouse/Touch value-struct clusters and
their IL-derived clamping, hashing, and formatting rules, the deliberate
`TouchLocation` equality asymmetry, the zero-synthetic-error measurement, and
the re-verified native ABI provenance.

See [Foundation 16 GamePadState evidence](docs/foundation-16-game-pad-state-evidence.md)
for the managed XInput packing, the IndependentAxes dead-zone reproduction, the
measured bit-for-bit agreement with the pinned `Buttons` literals, and why the
safe pure-managed seam was exhausted at the old mapping rules.

See [Foundation 17 managed class evidence](docs/foundation-17-managed-class-evidence.md)
for the general pure-managed CLR class rule, per-operation fallibility and its
accessor-level keys, the bit-exact `FlipHandedness` involution, the
negative-zero constructor defaults, the exact `bge.un.s` validation that accepts
NaN, and the 32 new negative fixtures. `AudioListener` and `AudioEmitter` are
pure managed descriptors: completing them claims no audio runtime capability
and creates no XACT state.

The qualified artifacts are CNA ABI 0.35.0 HEADLESS and OPENGLES3, both with
SDL3 audio. Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Web/Wasm are not qualified.
See [Foundation 18 interface evidence](docs/foundation-18-interface-evidence.md)
for the managed-interface projection rule, the measured `IEffectFog` split in
which only `FogColor` reaches D3DX, the two runtime-boundary contracts, the
separate Boolean and error channels of `BeginDraw`, and the exact event-mapping
gap that keeps `IUpdateable`, `IDrawable`, and `IGraphicsDeviceService`
deferred. `IUpdateable`, `IDrawable` and `IGameComponent` became live in
Foundations 30-32: `Game` keeps ordered lists of every `IUpdateable` and
`IDrawable` in `Components`, and `GameComponent` is a shipped implementor.
`IGraphicsDeviceService` and `IGraphicsDeviceManager` became live in
Foundation 49: `GraphicsDeviceManager`'s constructor registers itself under the
second and an adapter over itself under the first, exactly as the reference's
constructor registers `this` under both, so `Game.GraphicsDevice` and
`DrawableGameComponent.Initialize` resolve a device from a `Game` that
registered nothing of its own. (The effect runtime followed in Foundations 72
and 79-81.)

See [Foundation 19 IntPtr and PresentationParameters evidence](docs/foundation-19-intptr-presentation-parameters-evidence.md)
for the `System.IntPtr` to `uintptr` projection and exactly what it does not
authorize, the narrowed `RAW_HANDLE_LEAK` rule with its two-clean and ten-leak
fixtures, the complete descriptor contract, the `IsFullScreen` constructor
quirk, and why XNA 4.0 has no `Clear` here. `PresentationParameters` is a
descriptor, not a device: it stores a platform window handle and creates,
resets, enumerates, and presents nothing.

See [Foundation 20 touch collection evidence](docs/foundation-20-touch-collection-evidence.md)
for why `TouchCollection` was reachable after all, the first cluster that is at
once a CLR value type and fallible, the unconditional `NotSupportedException`
write side, `CopyTo`'s 64-bit overflow arithmetic, the operator-versus-`Equals`
search asymmetry, and the cursor's behavior at both ends. Completing it claims
no touch capability. (`TouchPanel` followed in Foundation 89, and it reads no
device because XNA 4.0's Windows touch surface is a stub.)

See [Foundation 21 service container evidence](docs/foundation-21-game-service-container-evidence.md)
for the general rule that a BCL interface whose members the XNA type already
declares publicly adds no projected surface, the duplicate-before-assignability
check order, and why a missing or absent service is an absence rather than a
failure. As of Foundation 30, `Game` exposes it and hands back one stable
container per Game. (Since Foundation 49 `GraphicsDeviceManager` registers
itself into it, exactly as the reference's constructor does.)

Foundations 30 through 33 qualify the managed Game component slice, with no
ABI expansion and no CNA change:

- `Game.Components` and `Game.Services`, each one stable managed identity;
- the component engine the reference keeps around them: two incrementally
  ordered derived lists, a pending-initialization queue, and the collection and
  order-changed handlers that maintain them;
- five explicit base-call functions, so an override decides whether and when
  base behavior runs, exactly as `base.Update(t)` does in CLR;
- complete `GameComponent`, satisfying `IGameComponent` and `IUpdateable` under
  a compiler-checked conformance rule;
- 34 external-consumer tests proving the whole loop from outside the module.

Nothing there renders. Component `Update` and `Draw` are called on the owner
thread with a tick-exact `GameTime`; what a component does there is its own.

See [Foundation 30 Game managed state evidence](docs/foundation-30-game-managed-state-evidence.md)
for why `Game::get_Components` and `::get_Services` are seven bytes of `ldfld`
each and therefore belong in Go rather than behind the C ABI, the component
engine derived from IL rather than from memory — Game does **not** sort its
components, both order comparers return 0 only for reference identity, and ties
are stable through an explicit forward walk rather than a stable sort — and the
`inRun` guard that decides whether an added component is queued or initialized
on the spot.

See [Foundation 31 base-call evidence](docs/foundation-31-game-base-call-evidence.md)
for why base behavior is never automatic: in CLR the override decides whether
and when the base runs, so CNA-Go supplies five package-level `GameBase...`
functions a callback may call, or not, or call in a different place. They are
measured language support and add nothing to any XNA identity counter. The
native callback order is audited against XNA's there.

See [Foundation 32 GameComponent evidence](docs/foundation-32-game-component-evidence.md)
for the class the engine was built for, the four load-bearing quirks it must
keep — including `On...` methods that ignore their sender and raise with `this`,
which is what makes the engine work — the `TryLock` projection of a reentrant
CLR `Monitor`, and the new general rule that a complete projected class must
satisfy every XNA interface its metadata declares, checked by `go/types`.

See [Foundation 33 XNA base frontier evidence](docs/foundation-33-xna-base-frontier-evidence.md)
for the second base frontier, which was silent until now: `Texture2D` inherits
nine public members from `Texture` and `GraphicsResource` that CNA-Go does not
project. Twelve relationships over 41 derived types are recorded with classified
blockers, and no derived type of a deferred XNA base may be reported complete.
That decision — XNA-to-XNA class inheritance — is the next architectural one.

See [Foundation 34 game event bridge evidence](docs/foundation-34-game-event-bridge-evidence.md)
for `Game.Activated`, `Deactivated`, `Exiting` and `Disposed`, bound to CNA
signals that were already published and had never been reached from Go. No CNA
C++ changed and CNA was not rebuilt; the ABI counters moved because CNA-Go binds
more of the same unchanged binary. `OnExiting` raises with a **null** sender
where its two siblings raise with the Game, and that one IL instruction is
preserved. Exactly one native subscription per event per Game, because CNA
invokes multiple registrations on one event in reverse order. `Deactivated` is
structurally complete but recorded as `NOT_RUN_ENVIRONMENT`: a HEADLESS artifact
has no window manager and can never lose focus.

See [Foundation 35 frame hook evidence](docs/foundation-35-game-frame-hook-evidence.md)
for `Game.BeginRun`, `EndRun`, `BeginDraw` and `EndDraw`. `BeginDraw`'s Boolean
stays a value channel separate from the error, because `DrawFrame` runs
`if (BeginDraw()) { Draw(); EndDraw(); }` and a false answer skips both. CNA's
four canonical frame hooks correspond position for position.

See [Foundation 39 Game disposal evidence](docs/foundation-39-game-disposal-evidence.md)
for `Game.Dispose()`, `Dispose(bool)` and `Finalize`, and for the raise-site
correction that came with them. `Game.Disposed` has exactly one raise site in the
reference -- the tail of `Dispose(bool)` -- so that is where CNA-Go raises it. It
fires when a consumer disposes and at no other time: ending a `Run` does not
raise it, and disposing twice raises it twice, because `Game` carries no disposed
flag anywhere. CNA's own disposal signal fires from native game destruction,
which is a different moment, so it is bound and counted for lifetime
qualification and raises nothing public.

See [Foundation 36 signal registry evidence](docs/foundation-36-signal-registry-evidence.md)
for the two registries that turn those decisions into measured facts: four
signals with three raise sites and one honest runtime deferral, and four frame
hooks each recording the canonical CNA hook at its position.

See [Foundation 38 frame hook override evidence](docs/foundation-38-frame-hook-override-evidence.md)
for how a consumer overrides those four. Declare the matching exported method on
the object you hand to `NewGame` and nothing else:

```go
func (c *Callbacks) BeginDraw(game *framework.Game) (bool, error) {
    // derived work before base
    return game.BeginDraw()          // the Go projection of base.BeginDraw()
}
```

Any **subset** of the four works, exactly as a CLR subclass may override any
subset. Each canonical CNA hook is installed **if and only if** its override
exists, so a callback object written before this mechanism existed opts into
nothing and its native frame positions are untouched. `GameCallbacks` still has
exactly five members, there is no registration API, and the four capabilities
are unexported structural interfaces you never name. The base is never run
automatically: calling `game.BeginDraw()` runs it exactly where your source says,
zero times or many, and cannot re-enter your override.

See [Foundation 40 base substitutability evidence](docs/foundation-40-base-substitutability-evidence.md)
for the measurement the XNA-to-XNA inheritance architecture turns on. Fifty-one
public signature positions in the profile name a class another class derives
from, and `GameComponent`, `GraphicsResource` and `MathTypeConverter` -- 25 of
the 41 derived types between them -- are named in **none** of them. For those
families private composition with explicit forwarding is not a compromise: there
is no position in the contract for a derived value to flow through, so no public
reference abstraction can be justified by it. (Eight families are live now.)

See [Foundation 41 XNA inheritance evidence](docs/foundation-41-xna-inheritance-evidence.md)
for the composition rule that measurement made safe. An XNA class inheriting
another projects the base as **private named composition plus explicit measured
forwarding** -- never Go embedding, which would promote the base's whole method
set and let a promoted member silently win where the derived class overrides it,
and never a public `Base`, `Parent` or `As...` accessor. `XNA_INHERITED` joins
`XNA_DECLARED` and `BCL_INHERITED` as the third provenance class, and the three
are asserted disjoint and exhaustive: 3243 declared projections that never move,
12 BCL-inherited and 24 XNA-inherited. `COMPOSED` states that the inheritance is
projected, not that any derived type is complete. (`DrawableGameComponent`
followed in Foundation 46; `GamerServicesComponent` is the profile's one
unprojected type.)

See [Foundation 42 Game timing evidence](docs/foundation-42-game-timing-evidence.md)
for `TargetElapsedTime`, `InactiveSleepTime`, `IsFixedTimeStep`,
`IsMouseVisible`, `SuppressDraw` and `ResetElapsedTime`. Each getter is the field
read it is in the reference and carries no error; each setter validates, stores,
and then pushes to the native loop, because in XNA the managed loop reads those
same fields every frame and here that loop is native. A `Game` configured before
`Run` is created with what it was configured with. The two `TimeSpan` setters
differ by one IL instruction and the difference is preserved: `InactiveSleepTime`
accepts zero, `TargetElapsedTime` does not.

The `Media`, `Audio`, `Storage` and `Input/Touch` packages are complete:
media metadata, library, pictures and playback (Foundations 95-97), sound
effects, microphones and XACT (87, 88, 98), storage (91) and the touch surface
(89). Every native fixture they play is silent and every playback path is
muted first.

See the generated [runtime capability inventory](docs/generated/runtime-capabilities.md)
for evidence and limitations by capability.

## Native runtime

The Go build uses cgo but does not link a developer CNA build at compile time.
Supply an admitted CNA C ABI shared library at runtime — major 0 with minor 35
or newer, qualified at 0.35.0:

```sh
export CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY=/absolute/path/to/libcna_c_api.so
```

The override must be an absolute regular-file path. Without it, the Linux
loader searches for `libcna_c_api.so`. Wrong ABI versions and missing required
symbols fail before Game creation. CNA-Go contains no checkout-relative native
library fallback and does not distribute CNA binaries.

## Development and verification

The maintained sibling `cna-go-template` uses a `go.work` file for local
development. A published module version is not claimed. Consumer qualification
instead extracts this repository's committed tree (`git archive`) and builds the
template with `GOWORK=off` and a `replace` to that exact source tree.

Useful gates are:

```sh
gofmt -l .
go vet ./...
go test ./...
go test -race -p 1 ./...   # -p 1: api_compat under -race needs the memory
go build -trimpath ./...
go run ./tools/api_compat
go run ./tools/api_compat --mode leak-only -report "" -missing "" -remaining ""
go run ./tools/behavior
go run ./tools/packed_vector_qualify
go run ./tools/capabilities --check
go run ./tools/native_abi -headers ~/deps/cna-c-abi-0.35.0/include -library ~/deps/cna-c-abi-0.35.0/lib/libcna_c_api.so
go run ./tools/external_consumer -source <extracted source tree>
go build -o build/bin/native_stress ./tools/native_stress   # run it as ROADMAP.md "Environment" says
```

Normal structural strict mode is expected to exit nonzero until all mapped XNA
surface exists; its missing-surface diagnostics are the work queue, not a
compatibility claim. The current count is in
[docs/generated/api-compat-report.json](docs/generated/api-compat-report.json)
and is not restated here, because a number written into prose goes stale the
next milestone and nothing checks it.
The native ABI and stress commands require the qualified native environment
described in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
`external_consumer` is the gate any public signature change must re-run: it
builds and runs the canary as its own module against an extracted source tree,
so a moved signature fails there rather than in a downstream consumer.

The normative rules are in [plan.md](plan.md), the language projection in
[docs/xna-go-mapping.md](docs/xna-go-mapping.md), the native boundary in
[docs/native-abi.md](docs/native-abi.md), and the resumable handoff in
[NEXT.md](NEXT.md).
