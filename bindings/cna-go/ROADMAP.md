# CNA-Go roadmap — what is done, and what remains

This file is the answer to "what is left?". It is written from **measured**
state, not from intent: every count below comes from a tool in this repository,
and every claim about what CNA can do comes from the canonical headers at
`~/deps/cna-c-abi-0.35.0/include/CNA/C/`, the artifact CNA-Go was last
requalified against (see `PROVENANCE.txt` there for the CNA commit).

Regenerate the numbers before trusting them:

```sh
go run ./tools/api_compat            # the scoreboard, docs/generated/, and the frontier
go run ./tools/native_abi -headers ~/deps/cna-c-abi-0.35.0/include \
                          -library ~/deps/cna-c-abi-0.35.0/lib/libcna_c_api.so
go run ./tools/external_consumer -source <extracted source artifact>

## Where the project stands

### Requalified against CNA C ABI 0.35.0 (2026-09-30)

CNA-Go's 696 bound routes, 457 manifest layouts and every prototype measured
**identical** between ABI 0.21.0 and 0.35.0 (`ABI_MISMATCHES=0` on both
artifacts), and none of the 855 routes CNA removed between them -- the engine
layer, the avatar real-rendering extension, the two Guide setters -- was ever
bound. The admission floor moved from 0.21 to **0.35**, because the runtime
evidence below depends on behaviour older artifacts do not have.

The requalification ran `native_stress` on two artifacts, 21 scenarios × 20
isolated cycles each, both green with no crash, use-after-free or double free:
`HEADLESS` (`docs/generated/native-stress-report.json`) and a real GPU through
`OPENGLES3` with compiled effects, CNAEXT and devices, inside a private
compositor (`docs/generated/native-stress-report-opengles3.json`). The
SOFTWARE artifact was not requalified and its 0.21 report was removed.

What changed is CNA, and every change moved toward XNA:

- **CNA now enforces XNA's Reach profile.** Separate alpha blending, 32-bit
  indices, occlusion queries, `GetBackBufferData` and `Texture3D` are refused
  under Reach, exactly where XNA's IL throws. The device-state scenario proves
  all five refusals under Reach; the four scenarios that exercise those features
  request HiDef first, the way a game does. Clearing a depth buffer a device
  does not have is refused too (`CannotClearNullDepth`).
- **`VERIFIED_PIXEL` on a real GPU.** Under HiDef, OPENGLES3 reads its back
  buffer, and the pixel slice passes: winding, geometry, material, alpha
  (rounded to (0,128,0,128) where the SOFTWARE renderer truncated to 127),
  lighting, and vertex colour -- whose fixture was repaired, because XNA
  multiplies the material by the vertex colour and the old green-on-yellow
  fixture could not tell honoured from ignored.
- Render-target readback, cube round trips, a real `Texture3D` and fresh
  occlusion results are measured on OPENGLES3; HEADLESS still refuses them.
- The media library and playback slices ran for the first time in committed
  evidence, inside an isolated `HOME`.
- Several recorded CNA findings are fixed upstream: SpriteFont measurement now
  clamps the last bearing as XNA does, BasicEffect publishes its 21
  EffectParameters, two subscriptions to one game event fire in registration
  order, and `cna_graphics_resource_dispose` really disposes. The findings that
  still reproduce are listed in `docs/native-abi.md`.

### The foundation history


The **whole 2D graphics path is closed and proved against a live renderer**:
`GraphicsDevice`, `SpriteBatch`, `Effect` and its eight companion types,
`Texture2D`/`TextureCube`/`Texture3D`, `RenderTarget2D`/`RenderTargetCube`, the
four state objects, the vertex/index buffers, `SpriteFont`, `ContentManager`,
the `Game` loop and `GraphicsDeviceManager`.

Foundation 73 produced the first **`VERIFIED_PIXEL`** evidence in the project:
on the SOFTWARE artifact, a cleared back buffer reads back and every texel
equals the clear colour, 20 cycles out of 20. Everything before it was
`VERIFIED_NATIVE_DRAW` — CNA accepted the submission and nothing could read the
result.

Foundation 74 composed `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<K,V>` and with it
projected `LaunchParameters` and `Game.LaunchParameters`. It is also the
milestone that made this file's numbers generated rather than remembered.

Foundation 75 projected `GraphicsDeviceInformation` and
`PreparingDeviceSettingsEventArgs` and closed **`GraphicsDeviceManager`**: the
device enumeration, the eight-step ranking policy, `CanResetDevice` and the
`PreparingDeviceSettings` event are all projected.

Foundation 76 projected `System.Exception` and closed `Game`. Foundation 77
projected the four stock vertex structs, and the native stress run submits all
four to CNA on both the HEADLESS and SOFTWARE artifacts, 220 user-primitive
draws with no refusal. Foundation 78 composed `System.Exception` and
`ExternalException` and projected all eight XNA exception types.

Foundation 79 composed **`Effect`** — the sixth composed XNA base and the second
whose RETURNS widen — and projected `BasicEffect`, `DirectionalLight` and
`IEffectLights`. The design turned on one measurement: CNA's stock BasicEffect
publishes **no EffectParameters** on either qualified artifact, so the
reference's push target does not exist and the push goes into CNA's own
stock-effect state instead. The reference's managed state and dirty flags are
kept, because forwarding every property to CNA would have made fourteen
infallible members fallible and contradicted interface signatures Foundation 18
measured from the same assembly.

Foundation 80 closed **`AlphaTestEffect`**, **`DualTextureEffect`** and
**`EffectMaterial`** on that shape, and measured the place it does not
generalise: the two unlit effects' `set_World` and `set_View` raise TWO
dirty-flag bits where BasicEffect's raise three, so a shared accessor body would
have been wrong and each type declares its own.

Foundation 81 closed **`EnvironmentMapEffect`** and **`SkinnedEffect`**, and
with them the whole stock-effect family: all six of `Effect`'s derived types are
projected. Both implement `IEffectLights::LightingEnabled` EXPLICITLY, so the
pinned contract lists no such property on either and both accessors are
interface witnesses; `TextureCube` became the fourth substitutable base, because
`EnvironmentMapEffect::EnvironmentMap` is the only TextureCube-typed parameter
position in the profile.

Foundation 82 closed the last two **root types**, `FrameworkDispatcher` and
`TitleContainer`. Both are static in the reference and both CNA routes take a
game handle for thread affinity, so both refuse outside a running game --
recorded rather than silently succeeding. `TitleContainer.OpenStream` carries
CNA's documented narrowing: that ABI has no stream handle for title content and
delivers the whole file instead, so the returned reader is over bytes already in
memory.

Foundation 83 closed **`OcclusionQuery`** and ran the probe the dynamic buffers
were waiting on. The hypothesis holds: CNA models a dynamic buffer through the
SAME routes as a static one, with a `dynamic` flag in the create info, an
`is_content_lost` field in the info snapshot, subscribe/unsubscribe routes for
the `ContentLost` event, and `SetDataOptions` in the transfer descriptors.

Foundation 84 closed **`DynamicVertexBuffer`** and **`DynamicIndexBuffer`**, and
with them the whole `Graphics` namespace. Three measurements decided it and none
was in the plan:

- **A successful `SetData` clears the content-lost latch.** Every `CopyData` in
  the family ends its setting path with
  `ldarg.0; isinst IDynamicGraphicsResource; ... SetContentLost(false)`, after
  the result check. `IDynamicGraphicsResource` is `assembly` and not in the
  contract, so it is projected as an unexported interface with the one member
  the reference dispatches on — and `RenderTarget2D` and `RenderTargetCube`,
  which had carried the latch and the event since Foundations 58 and 73 with
  nothing able to clear or raise them, now carry it too.
- **`SetDataOptions` is converted by a BIT TEST.** `ConvertXnaSetDataOptionsToDx`
  tests bit 0, then bit 1, and returns zero otherwise, so `Discard|NoOverwrite`
  is Discard and an undefined value is mapped rather than refused. CNA refuses an
  undefined option by name, so handing it the caller's raw value would refuse
  where the reference accepts.
- **The `dynamic` flag has exactly one observable.** Nothing in the contract
  reports it and `IsContentLost` answers false either way; CNA refuses a non-None
  `SetDataOptions` on a buffer created static, so a refusal on a buffer created
  dynamic is a defect rather than a capability, and the native scenario treats it
  that way.

`IsContentLost` still answers false on both qualified artifacts and the
`ContentLost` event still cannot fire there, because CNA documents the state as
"currently always false" — a limitation recorded rather than a defect, and the
boundary a renderer that can lose a device would move.

Foundation 85 raised the STRENGTH of evidence rather than the type count: the
first **`VERIFIED_PIXEL`** draw. Every draw proof from Foundation 60 to 84 was
`VERIFIED_NATIVE_DRAW` — CNA accepted the submission and nothing could read the
result back. The SOFTWARE artifact reads the back buffer and a `BasicEffect`
with lighting, texturing, fog and vertex colour off is a known solid material,
so the texels can now be checked:

- The **default `RasterizerState` culls a counter-clockwise triangle**, proved
  two-sided with the same three corners in the opposite winding order.
- The constructor's `DiffuseColor` default, `Vector3.One`, is seen as white.
- A half-screen triangle covers 192080 of 384000 texels with a measured corner
  pattern, so the GEOMETRY reaches the rasteriser rather than the draw acting
  as a clear.
- `DiffuseColor` decides the texel, and `Alpha` premultiplies it into both the
  colour and the alpha channel: `(0,1,0)` at `Alpha 0.5` comes back
  `(0,127,0,127)`.
- `VertexColorEnabled` and `EnableDefaultLighting` both reach CNA and this
  renderer ignores both, which is recorded in two counters each rather than
  asserted. The SOFTWARE artifact evaluates a FLAT MATERIAL -- `DiffuseColor`
  and `Alpha` -- and nothing per-vertex or per-light, which is the boundary any
  later pixel claim has to be written against.

Eleven planted defects, all killed, in a class no earlier suite could score:
deleting `BasicEffectSetDiffuseColor` from `OnApply` was invisible to the whole
project before this milestone. Foundation 80 named this in advance -- its two
unkilled push defects were "the same boundary that makes `VERIFIED_PIXEL` the
next thing worth building" -- and the boundary has moved for `BasicEffect` only,
so those two remain unkilled and are now killable in principle. Extending the
pixel slice to the other five stock effects is the obvious next lever.

HEADLESS has no readback path and records a refusal, pinned by the parent
accounting to the back buffer's own refusal count so the slice cannot quietly
stop running where it should.

Foundation 86 closed **`RendererDetail`**, the first type whose authority is the
Xact assembly rather than `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll` -- two strings and five
members with no native dependency, so projecting it needs no audio engine, no
bank and no device. Its `GetHashCode` needed the pinned mscorlib string hash,
which moved from the framework package into **`internal/bclhash`** so two
projected namespaces can share one body without adding public surface.

It also corrected a **stale blocker**. `xnaBaseRelationships` recorded that "the
qualification artifact pins a NULL audio renderer, so nothing behind it would
play"; `cna_audio_get_capabilities` reports `is_playback_available = TRUE` on
BOTH qualified artifacts, which `docs/generated/runtime-capabilities.md` had
already measured from a direct C probe. The audio family's remaining blocker is
CNA-Go's own surface and nothing else.

The capability route was bound end to end during that milestone and then
**reverted**: reading `Helpers::GetExceptionFromErrorCode` settled that XNA does
not probe for audio hardware at all -- it makes the native call and maps the
returned error code, and `NoAudioHardwareException` comes out of that switch. A
route with no faithful call site does not get bound, so the measurement is kept
and the binding is not.

Foundation 87 closed **`SoundEffect`** and **`SoundEffectInstance`** over 22
bound routes. They landed together because the pinned contract declares NO
public constructor for the instance: one comes from `CreateInstance` or from
`Play`'s pool and nowhere else.

The measurement that decided it is that **`GetSampleSizeInBytes` does not return
round numbers**. Its scale factor is computed in float32, and `(float)44100 /
1000f` is 44.099998474121094 -- so one second at 44.1kHz mono truncates to 44099
samples and **88198** bytes, not 88200. At 8000Hz and 48000Hz, whose thousandths
ARE representable, the counts are exact. At 44100 STEREO the round number comes
back, and not because the truncation went away: 44099 is odd, so
`samples % Channels` adds one sample back -- which is what makes the alignment
step an addition rather than a round-up.

Three members carry a "before the first Play" precondition -- `set_Pan`,
`Apply3D` and `set_IsLooped` -- and one private flag decides all three. The
native run found that the projection had dropped `set_IsLooped`'s guard entirely
AND never set the flag, so the pan/Apply3D mode latch could not latch either;
CNA surfaced it by refusing the call after playback exactly as the reference
does.

Every native fixture is SILENT PCM. The qualified artifacts open a real playback
device, so a fixture with signal in it would make audible noise on the machine
running the suite twenty times per cycle for no evidence gained. Silence
exercises creation, lifetime, transport and state identically; what it cannot
prove is audibility, and the scenario does not claim it.

`internal/dispatcher` joins `internal/bclhash` as the second internal package
this session: `FrameworkDispatcher.UpdateCalledAtLeastOnce` is `assembly`, not in
the contract, and read from another namespace, so Go leaves no other way to
share it without adding public surface.

Foundation 88 closed **`DynamicSoundEffectInstance`** and **`Microphone`**, and
with them the whole **`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio`** namespace.

A streaming instance can NEVER loop, and the reference says so twice: its
`get_IsLooped` returns a constant false and its `set_IsLooped` accepts only the
value the getter already reports. Both are overrides, which is what made
`SoundEffectInstance` the first COMPOSED base outside the graphics namespace --
and its identity site is the disposal refusal every member in the family
reaches.

The native scenario found a defect again, the third time this session. It
asserted the byte count the REFERENCE produces and CNA answered a different one:
one second at 22050Hz mono is **44098** bytes to XNA, whose scale factor is
computed in float32, and **44100** to CNA, which computes the exact arithmetic.
All four sample-conversion routes were bound and then reverted; both types now
use the managed `AudioFormat` body the reference reads. The fixture's rate is
load-bearing and the scenario says so -- 8000Hz would have agreed with the wrong
projection, because its thousandth is exact in binary32.

`Microphone.Start` and `Microphone.GetData` are projected because the contract
declares them and the suite calls NEITHER. `MICROPHONE_CAPTURE_CALLS` exists to
be zero and the parent accounting FAILS the run on any other value: a non-zero
value is a run that began recording on someone's machine.

Foundation 89 closed the **`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input`** namespace with
`GamePad`, `GamePadCapabilities`, `Mouse`, `TouchPanel` and
`TouchPanelCapabilities` -- and it is the milestone that bound the fewest
routes it planned to.

`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch.dll` **declares no p/invoke anywhere**.
`TouchPanelCapabilities::GetCaps()` is ten bytes that zero a local and return
it; `TouchPanel::GetState()` updates from a state it just zeroed; and
`ReadGesture()` has two branches, both `throw`, and no `ret` instruction at all.
XNA 4.0's touch surface shipped for Windows Phone and the Windows build kept the
API with the device half removed. CNA implements all fourteen touch routes for
real -- they were bound, measured, and **reverted** under
`CONTRACT_DIVERGENCE`, because the pinned IL is the behaviour authority and a
projection answering real touches would diverge on the first `GetState` a game
makes. `TOUCH_PANEL_NATIVE_CALLS` is asserted to be zero from inside a live game
with a working runtime available, which is what makes the zero mean something.

GamePad's readers share one body whose middle branch is the one that matters:
`0x48f` is `ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED`, and a disconnected controller answers
an EMPTY state with no exception. Only some other failure throws. This machine
has no controller, so that is the branch the stress run takes and
`GAMEPADS_CONNECTED` is a measured 0 rather than a skip. `SetVibration` is
called only with two zeros.

Foundation 90 closed the **Model family** and with it the whole
**`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics`** namespace: twelve types, the largest
single family in the profile.

It also settled a blocker that had stood since Foundation 29.
`ReadOnlyCollection<T>` was DEFERRED **as a base** because all four Model
collections declare their own `GetEnumerator`, which HIDES the inherited one,
and the collision rule would have hashed both names. The answer adopted here is
that a hidden base member is UNREACHABLE -- reaching one in C# needs a cast to
the base, and CNA-Go projects no base type to cast to -- so it is excluded
rather than renamed, and each collection keeps exactly one `GetEnumerator`.

Three of the four collections wrap an ARRAY and one wraps a `List<Effect>`, and
the difference is observable twice: only the List-backed view is LIVE, and only
its enumerator is version-checked. `ModelMeshPart.set_Effect` is what mutates
it, and it is a reference count -- the old effect leaves the mesh's Effects only
when no sibling still uses it.

`Model.Draw` draws every model in the process through ONE private static
`Matrix[]`, grown to fit and never shrunk. That is reproduced rather than made
safe: the reference is not thread-safe here, and hiding it would describe a
different runtime.

What is not claimed: no native slice exercises the draw path, because the
contract declares ZERO public constructors across all twelve types and a Model
reaches a consumer only through `ContentManager.Load<Model>`. The content-reader
family unblocks it.

Foundation 91 closed **`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage`** with `StorageDevice`
and `StorageContainer`, and it is the family a measurement chose rather than the
plan. Content plumbing was next on the list until `cna_content_reader_create`
turned out to need a `CNA_StorageStreamHandle`, which only `storage.h` produces.
The real chain is Storage, then content plumbing, then the Model family's native
draw slice.

XNA's storage APM is **fake async**, measured from XNA rather than taken from
CNA: `BeginShowSelector` invokes the callback and returns a completed result
before it exits, so `IsCompleted` is always true and the wait handle is always
signalled.

`StorageContainer` carries the reference's OWN containment guard --
`ValidateArguments` refuses any path that resolves outside the container root --
so "a game cannot reach the user's documents through this type" is XNA's rule,
not one this projection adds.

And the stress slice proves where it writes instead of assuming. The root was
measured first and turned out to be `~/.local/share/...`, outside the project;
CNA builds it from `XDG_DATA_HOME`, so the harness redirects that into the
repository AND the slice refuses to continue unless the root it reads back
actually lies there. `STORAGE_ROOT_CHECKS` is the counter that proves it ran.

Foundation 92 closed the **content plumbing**: `ContentReader`,
`ContentTypeReader`, `ContentTypeReader<T>`, `ContentTypeReaderManager` and
`ResourceContentManager`. That completes the chain Foundation 91 measured.

It did NOT unblock the Model family's native draw slice, which this document
claimed it would. Measuring the route afterwards is what settled it -- see
"What is left, and why" below.

Its lasting result is a rule rather than a family. **Three recorded blockers
were re-measured and all three were claims rather than measurements**:
`ReadOnlyCollection`-as-a-base (overturned in Foundation 90), BinaryReader's
supposed dependence on seeking (`ContentReader`'s IL contains ZERO
`Stream::Seek` call sites; the apparent hit was the substring of `get_CanSeek`
inside a helper whose check is skipped when the stream cannot seek), and
`ResourceManager` having "no CNA counterpart" (it occupies ONE contract position
and ONE member of it is used, so the settled role rule maps it to
`func(string) any`). A blocker written down in one milestone is evidence about
what was known then, not about what is true now.

The falsifiability run is where this milestone was actually corrected. Nine of
its 45 planted defects survived the first pass, all of them in the inherited
`BinaryReader` decode, because nothing could reach that code without a compiled
asset — and `cna_content_reader_create` needs a storage stream carrying one,
which the project does not author. The fix was to narrow `binaryReaderBase`'s
field to the single method it actually uses, which makes the *decoding*
reachable while the handle, the disposal latch and the short-read refusal stay
behind it. Scoring those nine as killed was the alternative and it was not taken.
A forty-sixth mutant is recorded as **equivalent**, with the argument for why,
and the harness asserts it SURVIVES.

Foundation 93 closed the **content serializer attributes** -- all five of them
-- and the interesting part is the base rather than the family.
`System.Attribute` had carried three recorded blockers since Foundation 29 and
**none of the three survived measurement**. "Go has no attribute metadata" is
true and does not stop the TYPES existing: the contract declares five classes
with constructors and properties, not an attaching operation, and the runtime's
own readers of these attributes (`ReflectiveReader<T>`,
`ReflectiveReaderMemberHelper`) are both `private` while CNA does the dispatch
anyway. The `GetCustomAttribute` blocker asked a question that answers itself
once measured -- those three members are STATIC. And the `TypeId` blocker was
already settled elsewhere, because an object-typed member projects to `any` and
`TypeId` really does hand back the runtime type.

What a consumer cannot do is ATTACH one of these attributes to a declaration.
That is recorded on the adapter and on each type rather than used to withhold
all five.

The mutation run again corrected the work rather than confirming it. Three
survivors showed that the projected `Equals` carried guards no input could
reach: `reflect.DeepEqual` already answers nil, already compares runtime types,
and already walks fields, so the reference's three separate steps collapse to
one call. The guards were removed rather than kept as decoration -- a guard no
input can reach is not documentation, it is a line that looks tested and is not.

Foundation 94 closed the **Design converters**, all thirteen, and with them the
**deferred frontier**: no base relationship in the project is deferred any more.

Its three blockers each named a SUBSYSTEM, and counting is what dissolved them.
`ITypeDescriptorContext` was recorded as "the single largest blocker in the
profile at thirteen types" -- it occupies thirty-eight parameter positions and
**zero of its members is ever called**, every one a pass-through. `CultureInfo`
is reached through two members, and in this profile a culture IS the thing that
separates list items. `IDictionary` is reached through one.

Two mappings were then corrected by measurement rather than by signatures.
`InstanceDescriptor` occupies no signature position and is still required twice
-- both `CanConvert` members compare `typeof` it, and every leaf's `ConvertTo`
constructs one. And `PropertyDescriptor` is not a `reflect.StructField`, because
`ColorConverter` reflects PROPERTIES where the vector converters reflect fields.

The mutation run found fourteen real test gaps and no equivalents on its first
pass -- a count check never given too many components, a message checked for
names but not for how they join, sixteen matrix cell descriptors never read.
All fourteen are covered and the second pass killed 49 of 49.

Foundation 95 closed the **media metadata graph**: `Song`, `Album`, `Artist`,
`Genre`, `Playlist` and their five collections, over **105 CNA routes** -- the
largest native binding in one milestone so far, taking `BOUND_FUNCTIONS` from
407 to 512.

Two fallibility rules gained a missing arm. `ToString`, `GetHashCode` and the
operators are blanket-exempted because in this profile they had always read
STORED state; `Song::ToString` is the first that does not, reaching a native
name, so `runtimeReadMembers` answers the exemption. And `get_IsDisposed` is one
`ldfld` on all ten, which is what `managedStoredMembers` is for.

The tests found a real defect in the projection: `mediaObject.usable()`'s nil
check could never fire through a nil outer pointer, because reaching the
embedded field is itself the dereference. Each type now shadows it.

The family has ONE public entry point -- `Song.FromUri` -- so that is what the
native slice walks, and it needed a fixture: CNA validates the file, which the
first run measured as `CNA_RESULT_IO` for a URI naming nothing. The slice
authors a 44-byte WAV, the way the content slice authors its PNG.

Foundation 96 closed the **media library and the picture graph**: `MediaLibrary`,
`MediaSource`, `Picture`, `PictureAlbum` and the two picture collections, over
64 more routes. `BOUND_FUNCTIONS` 512 → 581.

It is the entry point Foundation 95's ten types did not have. Those had one
public factory between them, so their collections could never be walked; this
one hands out eight collections directly, and **two of the three defects
Foundation 95 had to record as unscoreable are now scored**.

The slice that does it had to be contained first. An unisolated run found
**forty-one of the user's photographs** and read their dimensions and dates,
which is exactly the scanning of user media directories the standing constraint
forbids. CNA resolves those directories from `HOME` -- measured:
`XDG_PICTURES_DIR` does not move them and `HOME` does -- so the slice now
enumerates nothing until `HOME` is a directory the run was explicitly given, and
seeds that isolated library with its own three songs, three pictures and two
sub-albums. A run without one skips loudly and says so in `MEDIA_HOME_SKIPS`.

Foundation 97 closed **media playback** and with it the whole
`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media` namespace: `MediaPlayer`, `MediaQueue`, `Video`
and `VideoPlayer`, over 55 more routes. `BOUND_FUNCTIONS` 581 → 637.

`MediaPlayer` is entirely STATIC -- all twenty members -- so it projects as an
empty marker type plus package functions, the shape `TitleContainer` and
`FrameworkDispatcher` already have. Its two events are the first STATIC events
in the profile: their registration lists are process-wide because there is no
instance to hang them on, and the native subscription is made once and shared
because CNA's callback carries only a context.

`Video` is complete and **unreachable**, exactly as the Model family is: the
contract declares no constructor and CNA has no `load_video` route. That is
recorded on the type rather than papered over with a factory nothing measured.

The stress slice **mutes before it plays anything and proves the mute took** --
`MEDIA_PLAYBACK_MUTE_CHECKS` -- because MediaPlayer plays through the machine's
real audio output and a test is not entitled to make noise on someone's desktop.

Foundation 98 closed **XACT** -- `AudioEngine`, `AudioCategory`, `SoundBank`,
`WaveBank` and `Cue` -- and with it the whole `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio`
namespace. `BOUND_FUNCTIONS` 637 → 696, and **`GamerServicesComponent` is the
only type left in the profile.**

**The recorded blocker was overturned by measuring it a second time.** The
earlier note said the fixtures were reachable but EMPTY -- no cues, no
categories, no waves -- which was an honest measurement of the FLOOR and the
wrong question. CNA's own XACT demo ships a generator for all three formats, and
reading it is capability evidence of the kind this project admits from CNA: it
says what CNA's parser accepts and nothing about what XNA means. The
qualification now loads two authored categories, a settable global variable, two
real PCM waves and two named cues that play.

`AudioCategory` is the first STRUCT in the profile whose every member reaches a
runtime. The reference's copy holds an engine reference and an index; CNA has no
index, so the projected value holds a HANDLE, and two lookups of one name are
two handles that must still compare equal -- which is what
`cna_audio_category_equals` is for, and what the qualification asserts.

Four renderer routes are deliberately unbound. `RendererDetail`'s `ToString`,
`GetHashCode` and equality are pure managed and already projected; CNA's answers
for all three are different questions, and its hash could not reproduce the
pinned mscorlib string hash. Binding them would have made a value type's
identity depend on its position in a collection.

The slice mutes every authored category and counts the muting --
`XACT_MUTE_CHECKS` -- before it plays a cue, for the reason Foundation 97's
playback slice does.

## No partial types, and no missing members

**`PARTIAL_TYPES` and `MISSING_MEMBER` are both zero.** Every type CNA-Go
projects, it projects completely; what remains is ONE type it does not project
at all, and it is classified.

## What is left, and why

The per-family breakdown lives in **`docs/generated/remaining-work.md`**, which
is generated from the frontier registry in `tools/api_compat/frontier.go`. That
registry partitions the live missing-type set: every missing type belongs to
exactly one family, every family carries a classification, and a family that
names no blocker or claims a type that is no longer missing is a verifier
failure. `GLOBAL_UNREVIEWED` counts the missing types nobody has classified,
and it is zero.

**One type is left, and it is local work.** `GamerServicesComponent` was
reclassified from `BLOCKED_PLATFORM` back to **`ACTIONABLE_LOCAL`** on
2026-09-30. Foundation 99 held its dispatcher to be XNA's Games for Windows
LIVE proxy and said none of CNA's routes is that dispatcher; CNA declares
`cna_gamer_services_dispatcher_{set_window_handle,subscribe_installing_title_update_ext,initialize,update}`,
and a probe measured all four working on the HEADLESS artifact with no account
service configured. What remains is design inside this repository: the type
lives in its own namespace, so its private `GameComponent` base would be the
first composed base held across a package boundary (the derived-binding hook is
unexported), and `IUpdateable::Update` is projected infallible while the
dispatcher's update can fail. The archival requalification did not decide
either, so the type stays unprojected and says why.

**The Model family's native draw slice is no longer blocked upstream.** It was
blocked on assets: `cna_content_manager_load_model` accepted only a compiled
`.xnb`. At ABI 0.35.0 `models.h` documents the same route opening `.cnb`,
`.gltf` and `.glb` directly, which a harness can author. The slice was not
built in this pass; the family's types remain complete and projected.

**The dynamic-buffer note, closed.** Foundation 83 probed it, Foundation 84
acted on it, and the outcome was smaller than the note expected: **one** new
route, `cna_vertex_buffer_set_data_raw_at_with_options`. The index side needed
none — `cna_index_buffer_set_data` and `_set_data_at` already carried an
`options` argument, and the static overloads pass a hardcoded zero because the
reference hardcodes `SetDataOptions.None` there. The four
`subscribe_content_lost` / `unsubscribe_content_lost` routes stay unbound for
the reason `cna_render_target_subscribe_content_lost` does: CNA raises them only
on renderers that can lose a device (DirectX9, for example), and neither
qualified artifact -- HEADLESS and OPENGLES3 -- does.

## Two decisions that were open, and where they now stand

Both are closed. The five `ContentSerializer*Attribute` types were projected in
Foundation 93, and `System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter` got its measured
minimal closure with the Design converters in Foundation 94.

## The gates every milestone must pass

All of them must be green:

```sh
gofmt -l . && go vet ./...
go test ./...                                    # unit + verifier tests
go run ./tools/behavior                          # behaviour corpus
go run ./tools/api_compat                        # strict API + inventory + frontier
go run ./tools/api_compat --mode leak-only -report "" -missing "" -remaining ""
go run ./tools/packed_vector_qualify
go run ./tools/capabilities --check
go run ./tools/native_abi -headers ... -library ...   # ABI_MISMATCHES must be 0
go run ./tools/external_consumer -source <extracted source artifact>
go build -o build/bin/native_stress ./tools/native_stress
build/bin/native_stress                          # with the environment below
```

Three rules that are easy to lose and expensive to relearn:

- **The external consumer is a real gate.** It compiles the public surface from
  outside the module with `GOWORK=off`. A name that only works inside the
  repository has not shipped.
- **No speculative route binding.** Every bound CNA route needs a production
  call site *today*, and `tools/native_abi/reachability_test.go` enforces the
  whole chain. A route with no caller belongs in the deliberately-unbound
  registry with its measured reason.
- **ABI prototypes come from the canonical headers**, compiler-backed via
  `tools/native_abi/testdata/probe.c`. Never from a manifest alone.

## Environment

- **Never build in the scratchpad or `/tmp`.** Use `build/`, `build-probe/`,
  `build-consumer/`, and point `TMPDIR` and `GOTMPDIR` into `build/`.
- **`native_stress` must be isolated.** `CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY` names the artifact;
  `CNA_GO_STORAGE_ROOT` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` name a project-owned storage root;
  `CNA_GO_MEDIA_HOME` and `HOME` name a project-owned media home. Build the tool
  first, because a changed `HOME` moves Go's build cache.
- **A windowed artifact never opens on a desktop.** OPENGLES3 runs inside CNA's
  `tools/platform/run_gpu_tests_private.sh --exec ...` (private Weston and
  Xwayland on the real GPU) with `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11` and, since that
  environment has no audio server, `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=dummy`. HEADLESS needs no
  display.
- Qualified artifacts: `~/deps/cna-c-abi-0.35.0` (HEADLESS) and
  `~/deps/cna-c-abi-0.35.0-opengles3-fx` (OPENGLES3); the library is
  `lib/libcna_c_api.so` in each.
- The Go toolchain this repository is qualified with is `~/deps/go1.24.4`.
