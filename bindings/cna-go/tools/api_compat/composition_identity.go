// Milestone 55 — CLR object identity under composition.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// # The problem private named composition creates, and this measures
//
// In CLR, `ldarg.0` inside a base class's body is the WHOLE object. Composition
// splits that object in two, and the base half has no way back to the whole
// one. Every reference site that uses `ldarg.0` as an OBJECT -- an event
// sender, a collection identity, a ToString subject -- then means the base
// half, which is not the object the consumer holds:
//
//	GameComponent::Dispose(bool)
//	  Game.Components.Remove(this)     // removes the base; the collection
//	                                   // holds the DERIVED object
//	  Disposed(this, EventArgs.Empty)  // announces the base as the sender of
//	                                   // the derived object's event
//
// Both were live before Milestone 55 measured them: a DrawableGameComponent
// survived Game.Dispose still in Game.Components, and its three inherited
// events announced a sender no consumer could match.
//
// A site that uses `ldarg.0` merely to REACH A FIELD is not affected and is not
// listed: the state it reads is the base's own.
//
// # The projection
//
// The composed base holds an unexported reference to the outermost derived
// object, installed by the derived constructor and read only through an
// unexported accessor. It is not exported, not a public Base/Parent accessor,
// and not reachable from outside the module -- the settled composition rule is
// unchanged; this is what makes it CORRECT rather than merely private.
//
// # What is checked
//
// Structurally, from the Go syntax tree rather than from text:
//
//  1. every COMPOSED XNA base has an identity entry, so a future composed base
//     cannot skip the decision by saying nothing;
//  2. the Go base type declares the unexported derived-reference field;
//  3. the base declares the unexported bind and self members, both unexported;
//  4. every recorded identity site on the base REACHES the self accessor in its
//     own body -- a site that used the bare receiver would compile and would be
//     wrong, so this is the only mechanical way to hold it;
//  5. every projected derived type's constructor installs itself through the
//     bind member.
//
// Recording the sites is half the evidence: a site list that omits a real
// `ldarg.0` object use is a gap, so each entry carries the IL it comes from.

	// would be a second answer that could disagree. Texture is such a link: it
	// takes a bind and passes it to GraphicsResource, and holds no derived
	// field or self accessor of its own.
	//
	// Foundation 79 separated the two halves of that claim. A middle link must
	// hold no derived field and must declare no self accessor -- one holder per
	// chain -- but it may still have SITES, because a middle link is a class
	// with members of its own and one of those members can use the object.
	// Effect is the first: set_CurrentTechnique reports the runtime type in an
	// ObjectDisposedException, and on a BasicEffect that type is BasicEffect.
