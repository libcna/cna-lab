// Command resource_strings verifies that every exact Microsoft resource message
// CNA-Go claims appears VERBATIM in a retained XNA 4.0 assembly.
//
// # Why it exists
//
// CNA-Go reproduces exception messages byte for byte, and the IL disassembly in
// ~/deps/xna-il-cache/ cannot supply them: it shows the `Resources::get_<Key>()`
// call and never the value the key names. So a message has to be read out of the
// assembly's .resources stream -- and until Foundation 49 nothing checked that
// one had been.
//
// Foundation 48 inferred `BackBufferDimMustBePositive` from its key and wrote
// "The back buffer dimension must be positive." The real string is
// "BackBufferWidth and BackBufferHeight must be greater than zero." It named the
// two properties rather than "the dimension" and said "greater than zero" rather
// than "positive", and nothing in the repository could tell the difference,
// because a plausible sentence looks exactly like a measured one.
//
// Foundation 49 closed that with a SUBSTRING search over the raw assembly
// bytes. Foundation 50 replaced it with a real read of the assembly's resource
// sets, keyed by name -- see resources.go -- because a substring search checks
// only half the claim. It proves the sentence is Microsoft's; it cannot prove
// it is filed under the key the reference's throw site calls. The audio-emitter
// message was recorded under `DopplerScaleMustBeGreaterThanOrEqualToZero`, a
// key that exists nowhere; the string is real and its key is
// `InvalidEmitterDopplerScale`. Four milestones of substring searches passed
// it.
