// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Foundation 60 — the two state-carrying SpriteBatch.Begin overloads.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// # A null state argument is a DEFAULT, not a refusal
//
// Every Begin overload funnels into the seven-argument one, which stores its
// arguments and then calls SetRenderState. That method is where the nulls are
// resolved, and its IL names each substitute:
//
//	blendState        ?? BlendState.AlphaBlend
//	depthStencilState ?? DepthStencilState.None
//	rasterizerState   ?? RasterizerState.CullCounterClockwise
//	samplerState      ?? SamplerState.LinearClamp   (applied as SamplerStates[0])
//
// CNA documents exactly the same four substitutes for its own null arguments,
// which is a useful agreement but not the authority: these are read off
// SetRenderState.
//
// # SetRenderState applies them TO THE DEVICE
//
// It calls `GraphicsDevice::set_BlendState` and its two siblings, so after
// `spriteBatch.Begin(mode, myBlend)` the device answers `myBlend` from
// `BlendState` and `myBlend` is frozen. That is observable and is reproduced.
//
// CNA takes all four descriptors on one route,
// `cna_sprite_batch_begin_with_states`, so the values reach the renderer ONCE
// rather than through four separate device calls followed by a fifth. The
// managed half of set_BlendState -- the device's cached object and the state's
// freeze -- is performed here so the observable result is the reference's,
// and the native half is performed by the one route that needs it.

// BeginBySpriteSortModeAndBlendState is
// SpriteBatch::Begin(SpriteSortMode, BlendState).
//
// It forwards to the seven-argument Begin with four nulls and Matrix.Identity,
// so the sampler, depth-stencil and rasterizer states are the defaults
// SetRenderState substitutes.

// BeginBySpriteSortModeAndBlendStateAndSamplerStateAndDepthStencilStateAndRasterizerState

// Begin overload the type was missing.
//
// It forwards to the seven-argument Begin with Matrix.Identity, which is what
// CNA's own route expresses as a NULL transform.
//
// A null Effect is not a refusal: SpriteBatch::SetRenderState resolves it to
// the stock sprite effect, and CNA documents CNA_INVALID_HANDLE as selecting
// exactly that. So the two runtimes agree, and this overload is the difference
// between "the batch draws with the default shader" and "the batch draws with
// mine" rather than between drawing and refusing.

// BeginBySpriteSortModeAndBlendStateAndSamplerStateAndDepthStencilStateAndRasterizerStateAndEffectAndMatrix
// is the seven-argument Begin every other overload funnels into.
//
// The transform reaches CNA as sixteen floats in row-major order, and a caller
// that passes Matrix.Identity gets the same result as the six-argument
// overload -- which is the identity CNA substitutes for a null transform, so
// the two paths agree by construction rather than by coincidence.

// # All FOUR overloads reach ONE native route

// Foundation 60 sent the two effect-free overloads to
// `cna_sprite_batch_begin_with_states`, which cannot express an effect. Now that
// all four exist, they all reach `cna_sprite_batch_begin_with_effect`, because
// the REFERENCE has one Begin body and this is the route whose prototype
// matches it: CNA documents CNA_INVALID_HANDLE as selecting the stock sprite
// effect and a null transform as the identity, which is precisely what the two
// short overloads supply.
//
// Keeping the narrower route bound as well would give one reference path two
// native paths that could drift, which is the shape Foundation 50 accepted for
// Draw only because CNA declares those two commands for a measured reason. Here
// there is none: the wider route's contract contains the narrower one's.
