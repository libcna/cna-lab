// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Foundation 56 — GraphicsResource, the root of the graphics base chain.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// GraphicsResource is Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsResource: the
// abstract root eleven graphics types derive from, and the type whose deferral
// blocked all eleven.
//
// # It has no public constructor, and that is read from the IL
//
//	.class public abstract auto ansi beforefieldinit GraphicsResource
//	       extends [mscorlib]System.Object
//	       implements [mscorlib]System.IDisposable
//	  .method assembly hidebysig specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor()
//
// `assembly` is internal. A consumer cannot construct one in C# either, so
// CNA-Go declares no `NewGraphicsResource` and the pinned contract declares no
// constructor member for it. The type exists so its surface can be composed
// onto the types that DO have constructors.
//
// # Its state, field for field
//
//	.field private string  _localName
//	.field private object  _localTag
//	.field class GraphicsDevice _parent
//	.field assembly uint64 _internalHandle
//	.field assembly bool   isDisposed
//	.field private EventHandler`1<EventArgs> <backing_store>Disposing
//
// `_internalHandle` is the native object. In CNA-Go that is one
// `*interop.Resource`, and it lives HERE rather than on the derived type, for
// the reason the reference puts the handle here too: there is exactly one
// native owner per logical object, and a derived wrapper that held its own
// would be a second one. The derived types keep only what the reference keeps
// on them -- Texture's format and level count, Texture2D's width and height.
//
// # Ownership
//
//	OWNED, generation-checked, released exactly once.
//
// `interop.Resource` carries the kind tag, so the type-specific release the
// reference's `ReleaseNativeObject` override performs is already inside
// `Resource.Dispose`. That is why CNA-Go needs no per-derived-type release
// hook: the one CNA resource knows how to destroy itself.
//
// # Name and Tag are managed here, and CNA's own routes are deliberately unused
//
// The reference's accessors are conditional:
//
//	get_Name: if (_internalHandle != 0)
//	              return _parent.Resources.GetCachedName(_internalHandle);
//	          return _localName;
//
// `DeviceResourceManager::GetCachedName` is 79 bytes of
// `Dictionary<ulong, ResourceData>` under a `Monitor`, answering `String.Empty`
// for an absent key. It is managed storage reached indirectly, with no D3D call
// and no throw site, which is why both accessors are infallible.
//
// CNA DOES have a counterpart -- `cna_graphics_resource_set_name`,
// `copy_name`, `get_tag`, `set_tag`, `get_is_disposed` and six more -- and
// Foundation 56 said it did not. Foundation 57 measured them against the pinned
// artifact and left them unbound for reasons that are now recorded per route in
// tools/native_abi's `deliberatelyUnboundRoutes`. Two decide this member:
//
//	the routes REFUSE a SpriteBatch handle (CNA result 2), and SpriteBatch is a
//	GraphicsResource in the pinned contract, so binding them would make one XNA
//	member answer for textures and fail for sprite batches; and
//
//	cna_graphics_resource_set_name validates UTF-8 and refused an embedded NUL,
//	while set_Name validates nothing at all -- so binding it would refuse names
//	the reference accepts and make an infallible member fallible.
//
// Both are therefore MANAGED STORED members and neither is fallible, which is
// the settled per-operation fallibility rule applied to the reference's body.
