// DrawableGameComponent is the Go projection of
// Microsoft.Xna.Framework.DrawableGameComponent: a GameComponent that also
// draws, and the profile's one shipped IDrawable implementor.
//
// # It composes GameComponent, and does not embed it
//
// The settled XNA-to-XNA inheritance rule is private named composition plus
// explicit measured forwarding. The base object is private state, there is no
// Base/Parent/AsGameComponent accessor, and nothing is promoted: every
// inherited member below is a forwarding method written out, so a member this
// class overrides cannot silently keep the base's body.
//
// # What blocked it, and what unblocked it
//
// Initialize's body resolves Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.IGraphicsDeviceService
// out of Game.Services. The Graphics package imports this one, so this package
// cannot name that contract, cannot build the reflect.Type token GetService is
// keyed by, and cannot spell the return type of the service's device accessor.
// The cross-package cycle rule projects device-typed MEMBERS into the
// descendant package, which a private field resolution inside a method body
// cannot use.
//
// internal/servicebridge is the narrowest thing that resolves it: two function
// values, installed from package inits, adding no public API and holding no
// object. The Graphics package installs a resolver that knows the token and can
// compare a device with nil; this package installs a reader so the Graphics
// package can project get_GraphicsDevice over private state here.
//
// A program that never imports the Graphics package installs no resolver and
// resolves nothing -- which is correct rather than a gap, because registering
// an IGraphicsDeviceService requires naming it, which requires importing that
// package.
//
// # The virtual calls Initialize makes
//
// The reference's Initialize ends with `if (deviceService.GraphicsDevice !=
// null) this.LoadContent();`, and DeviceCreated/DeviceDisposing call
// LoadContent/UnloadContent the same way. All three are `callvirt`, so in the
// CLR a subclass override runs.
//
// Go has no virtual dispatch, and the settled rule since Foundation 31 is that
// base behaviour is explicit and never automatic. So those calls reach the
// bodies projected here, which are the reference's own: LoadContent,
// UnloadContent and Draw are each a bare `ret` of code size 1. A consumer's own
// LoadContent is not reached, exactly as a consumer's own Update is not reached
// by base Update, and for the same reason.
