// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Foundation 63 — the two generic ContentManager members.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// # Both are package functions, on the settled generic-method rule
//
// Go methods cannot declare type parameters, so a CLR generic instance method
// projects as a package-level generic FUNCTION taking the receiver first. These
// are the first two members in the profile whose RETURN is the type parameter,
// which is what the verifier fix below exists for.
//
// # What T may be, and why the set is closed
//
// The reference's Load<T> reads an `.xnb` and hands back whatever the content
// reader produced, so its T is open. CNA's content pipeline exposes one route
// per asset kind, and CNA-Go binds the one whose asset type it projects:
//
//	*graphics.Texture2D    cna_content_manager_load_texture2d
//	*graphics.SpriteFont   cna_content_manager_load_sprite_font
//	*graphics.Effect       cna_content_manager_load_effect
//
// A T outside that set is refused BY NAME, which is the same shape the texture
// transfer rule takes: the CLR would fail at runtime for an asset whose reader
// does not match, and reporting the type is more useful than reporting a cast.
//
// SpriteFont joined this list in Foundation 69 and Effect in Foundation 72,
// each when its type became real. CNA also publishes loaders for SoundEffect,
// TextureCube and Model. SoundEffect has been a projected type since Foundation
// 87 and TextureCube since 71 -- and at ABI 0.35.0 a cube's data round-trips on
// the OPENGLES3 artifact -- so neither is blocked any more; they are unbound
// because no milestone after those foundations added them, which is recorded
// rather than hidden.

// errContentUnsupportedAsset projects the refusal a T outside the closed set
// gets. The reference has no counterpart -- its Load<T> would throw
// ContentLoadException from the reader -- and the difference is recorded: the
// projection refuses BEFORE the load, on the Go type, rather than after it on
// the asset's declared reader.

// The cache is CNA's: `cna_content_manager_load_texture2d` goes through the
// native content manager, which caches by normalized key, so a second Load of
// the same name answers from it. That is why the projection keeps no cache of
// its own -- two caches would be two answers.
