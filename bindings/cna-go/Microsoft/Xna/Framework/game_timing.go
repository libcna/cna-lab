// This file projects Game's timing and presentation state:
//
//	InactiveSleepTime   TimeSpan   get/set
//	TargetElapsedTime   TimeSpan   get/set
//	IsFixedTimeStep     bool       get/set
//	IsMouseVisible      bool       get/set
//	SuppressDraw()
//	ResetElapsedTime()
//
// # Getters are field reads, setters reach the loop
//
// In the reference every one of these getters is a single `ldfld`, and the
// managed loop reads the SAME fields every frame. CNA-Go's loop is the native
// one, so the split falls out of that difference and is not a choice:
//
//   - the getter stays a field read of Game's own managed state, exactly as the
//     reference's is. It allocates nothing, validates nothing, reaches nothing,
//     and works before Run, during it and after it;
//   - the setter validates as the reference does, stores as the reference does,
//     and then pushes the value to the native loop -- because that loop is what
//     the reference's own loop would have read, and a stored value the loop
//     never sees would be a setter that appears to work and does not.
//
// # Nothing here was added to CNA
//
// All six canonical operations were already exported by the pinned artifact and
// had simply never been reached from Go:
//
//	cna_game_set_is_mouse_visible          cna_game_reset_elapsed_time
//	cna_game_set_is_fixed_time_step        cna_game_suppress_draw
//	cna_game_set_target_elapsed_time_ticks
//	cna_game_set_inactive_sleep_time_ticks
//
// The corresponding cna_game_get_* functions are deliberately NOT bound. The
// reference reads its own field, so binding the native getter would introduce a
// second source of truth that could disagree with the first.
//
// # Before Run, during Run, after Run
//
// With no live native game a setter stores and reports success, and the stored
// value is carried into cna_game_create -- which is why the create info no
// longer passes literals. That is the reference's behaviour too: a Game
// configured before Run runs with what it was configured with.
//
// During a run the setter reaches the loop on the owner thread. From another
// goroutine CNA answers CNA_RESULT_THREAD and the setter reports it, which is
// more useful than reproducing a value the loop will not honour.

//	isFixedTimeStep    = true
//	targetElapsedTime  = TimeSpan.FromTicks(0x28b0b)      // 166667, 1/60 s
//	inactiveSleepTime  = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(20)    // 200000 ticks
//
// isMouseVisible is not assigned by the constructor and therefore defaults to
// false, which is Go's zero value for the field as well.

// Tick is Game::Tick.
//
// # What the reference does
//
// In the reference Tick is 682 bytes of managed clock arithmetic: it advances
// the GameClock, sleeps or spins toward TargetElapsedTime when IsFixedTimeStep
// is set, clamps the accumulator at maximumElapsedTime, runs one or more
// Updates, and calls DrawFrame unless suppressDraw asked it not to. It does NOT
// touch the host, and it does NOT call Initialize or LoadContent.
//
// # Why it is native here
//
// CNA-Go's loop is the native one -- that is the settled split, and it is why
// the timing setters push to CNA rather than being read by a managed loop. The
// clock Tick advances is CNA's, so the projection is cna_game_tick, which
// CNA's own Game::Tick implements with the same shape: advance, sleep or yield
// under a fixed step, poll, clamp, update, draw.
//
// # Why it can be called at all
//
// Until Foundation 47 a native game existed only inside the blocking Run, so
// there was no reachable moment for a frame step and projecting one would have
// meant projecting a member that could only ever fail. CNA creates a game with
// cna_game_create and destroys it with cna_game_destroy; the loop is a separate
// call. So the first Tick creates the native game, which is what the
// reference's constructor does through EnsureHost, and every later one drives
// it. Game.Dispose destroys it.
//
// # What a first Tick does NOT do
//
// It does not initialize. Measured against the qualified artifact, a tick on a
// never-run game delivered Update and Draw and neither Initialize nor
// LoadContent -- which is the reference's behaviour, because Tick has no
// initialization step. A consumer who wants Initialize should use RunOneFrame
// or Run.
//
// # Threading
//
// The goroutine that takes the first frame step owns the session's OS thread
// for its whole life, and every later step, Run, and Dispose must come from
// that same goroutine. A step from anywhere else reports ErrWrongThread, and a
// step from inside a lifecycle callback is refused by CNA itself, because a
// frame step called from within a frame would re-enter the loop it is part of.

	if g == nil || g.runtime == nil {

	}

}

// RunOneFrame is Game::RunOneFrame:
//
//	if (this.host != null) this.host.RunOneFrame();
//
// In the reference the host is never null after construction, so the member is
// effectively one virtual call into WindowsGameHost::RunOneFrame, which is
// `this.gameWindow.Tick()` -- pump the platform's messages, then one Game.Tick.
//
// CNA's cna_game_run_one_frame is the same wrapper with ONE measured
// difference, and it is a difference in CNA rather than in this projection:
//
//	CNA   if (!hasInitialized_) { DoInitialize(); hasInitialized_ = true; } Tick();
//	XNA   window.Tick() -> game.Tick()
//
// So a first RunOneFrame delivers Initialize and LoadContent where the
// reference's delivers neither. That was measured against the qualified
// artifact rather than read from a comment, it is recorded as an upstream
// difference in the Foundation 47 evidence, and it is not worked around: CNA
// offers no route that runs a host frame without initializing, and cna_game_tick
// -- which does not initialize -- polls events too, so it is not that route
// either.
//
// Everything else is Tick's: the first call creates the native game, the
// calling goroutine owns it, and Game.Dispose destroys it.
