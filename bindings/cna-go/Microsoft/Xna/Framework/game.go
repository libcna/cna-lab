// Game is the concrete Go facade for the XNA Game class. Protected virtual
// overrides are supplied separately through GameCallbacks because Go has no
// inheritance or virtual methods.
//
// # Game is a hybrid host
//
// The division of responsibility is deliberate and is read from the reference
// per member, not assumed per type:
//
//   - The native CNA runtime owns the real host, the frame loop, the window,
//     the device and the platform. That is GameHost's and WindowsGameHost's
//     role in Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dll, and CNA-Go does not reimplement
//     it in Go.
//   - Go owns the managed CLR state. Game::get_Components and
//     Game::get_Services are one `ldfld` each over fields the Game constructor
//     assigns, and the component engine that maintains them is ordinary managed
//     list work. Routing that through a C ABI would invent native ownership and
//     a native failure mode the reference does not have, so it stays in Go.
//   - GameCallbacks stays the language adapter for the protected virtual
//     overrides, and base behavior is reached explicitly through the
//     GameBase... functions rather than being run automatically.
//
// # The managed state below
//
// The five unexported lists are Game's own private fields in the reference and
// are not exposed by any projected member. See game_component_engine.go for the
// exact derivation of how they are maintained.
