// Package servicebridge is the one place the framework package and the
// Graphics package agree on something neither can name in the other.
//
// # Why it exists
//
// DrawableGameComponent::Initialize is declared on a type in
// Microsoft.Xna.Framework, and its body resolves
// Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.IGraphicsDeviceService out of Game.Services:
//
//	this.deviceService = this.Game.Services.GetService(typeof(IGraphicsDeviceService))
//	                     as IGraphicsDeviceService;
//
// In the CLR both namespaces live in assemblies that reference each other's
// direction freely. In Go the Graphics package imports the framework package,
// so the framework package cannot name IGraphicsDeviceService, cannot build the
// reflect.Type token GetService is keyed by, and cannot spell the return type
// of the service's GraphicsDevice accessor.
//
// The settled cross-package cycle rule handles the MEMBER side of that -- a
// device-typed member projects into the descendant package -- but a private
// field resolution inside a framework-declared method body is not a member and
// the rule does not reach it.
//
// # What it is, and what it deliberately is not
//
// It is two function values, each installed once from a package init, and read
// by the other side. It is NOT a service locator, a registry of live objects,
// or a cache: nothing here holds a Game, a component, a device or a service
// beyond the duration of one call, so nothing here can keep an object alive.
//
// It adds no public API. Both halves are internal, so no XNA identity, no
// exported type and no exported function is created by this file, and
// tools/api_compat's unexpected-member scan sees nothing new.
//
// # Why "no resolver installed" is the correct answer rather than a gap
//
// The framework package does not import the Graphics package, so a consumer who
// never imports Graphics never runs its init and no resolver is installed. That
// is exactly right: to register an IGraphicsDeviceService a consumer must be
// able to NAME IGraphicsDeviceService, which requires importing the Graphics
// package. A program that cannot have registered the service resolves nothing,
// and DrawableGameComponent::Initialize reports the reference's own
// InvalidOperationException. The absence is correct by construction rather than
// by a runtime check.
