;;;; storage-device.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage.StorageDevice.
;;;;
;;;; **This file is where Storage's first design question is answered, and the
;;;; answer is: keep the pair, invent no concurrency.** The full argument is in
;;;; `docs/limitations.md'; the evidence is here, because it is what makes the
;;;; decision obvious rather than a preference.
;;;;
;;;; --- XNA's async is a fiction, and the IL says so in four places -----------
;;;;
;;;; `StorageDeviceAsyncResult' implements `IAsyncResult', and every member of
;;;; that interface is a constant:
;;;;
;;;;   .ctor              `new ManualResetEvent(true)' -- **already signalled**
;;;;   CompletedSynchronously  `ldc.i4.1; ret' -- a literal true
;;;;   IsCompleted        `mre.WaitOne(0, false)' on that signalled event, so
;;;;                      **always true**
;;;;   AsyncWaitHandle    the signalled event itself
;;;;
;;;; And the two halves do this:
;;;;
;;;;   BeginShowSelector  validates its arguments, makes the result object, and
;;;;                      **invokes the caller's callback before it returns**
;;;;   EndShowSelector    type-checks, refuses a second call, and **constructs
;;;;                      the device** -- which is the actual work
;;;;
;;;; So a program that calls `Begin' and then `End' has made a synchronous call
;;;; with two names, and there is nothing to wait for at any point. CNA reached
;;;; the same conclusion and says so: its selector routes "collapse the canonical
;;;; `BeginShowSelector'/`EndShowSelector' pair, which CNA completes
;;;; synchronously; no operation handle is invented for work that never pends".
;;;;
;;;; --- so the projection keeps both members and adds nothing ----------------
;;;;
;;;; Both are projected. The callback still fires inside `Begin'. `End' still does
;;;; the work and still refuses a second call. **No promise, no future, no
;;;; thread**: inventing concurrency here would be giving `StorageDevice' a
;;;; capability XNA has not got, which is the one thing this projection may never
;;;; do -- and it would be inventing it for an operation that is already finished
;;;; before the caller can look at it.
;;;;
;;;; The `IAsyncResult' becomes an opaque object of a private class, exactly as
;;;; `System.IO.Stream' becomes a Common Lisp stream: the interface is the base
;;;; class library's and is not a projected type. Its one public reader is
;;;; `ASYNC-STATE', because the state a caller passed to `Begin' is the one thing
;;;; it can observe through the interface and would otherwise have no way back to.
;;;;
;;;; **`Begin' makes no native call, and that is deliberate.** CNA's selector
;;;; route produces the device, so the work could have gone in either half.
;;;; Putting it in `End' matches XNA -- where the device really is constructed
;;;; there -- and means a program that calls `Begin' and never calls `End'
;;;; creates no handle and leaks nothing. The other arrangement would have made
;;;; an owned device nobody asked for.
;;;;
;;;; --- what the four Begin overloads actually validate -----------------------
;;;;
;;;; From the IL, in order, and the two-argument forms delegate to the
;;;; four-argument one with `sizeInBytes' 0 and `directoryCount' 1:
;;;;
;;;;   player != 0xff && (player < 0 || player > 3) -> ArgumentOutOfRangeException
;;;;   sizeInBytes < 0                              -> ArgumentOutOfRangeException
;;;;
;;;; **`directoryCount' is never validated and never read.** It is accepted,
;;;; carried nowhere, and has no effect in the original; CNA takes it and its
;;;; header does not promise anything of it either. So it is accepted here and
;;;; documented as ignored rather than quietly dropped from the signature, which
;;;; would remove an overload.

what it is given, exactly as an XNA handler would.

**No native call happens here.** The device is created by the `End' half, which is
where XNA creates it too, so a program that begins and never ends creates no
handle.
