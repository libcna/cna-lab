;;;; storage-stream.lisp --- the Common Lisp stream a storage file opens as.
;;;;
;;;; **This is the answer to the second of Storage's two design questions, and
;;;; the argument is in `docs/limitations.md'.** The short form:
;;;;
;;;; `StorageContainer.CreateFile' and its three `OpenFile' overloads answer
;;;; `System.IO.Stream'. This binding already declares what that projects onto --
;;;; "`System.IO.Stream' is a Common Lisp stream, and is not a projected type" --
;;;; and `Texture2D.FromStream' and `SaveAsPng' already move bytes across ordinary
;;;; CL binary streams. What Storage adds is that the stream on the *other* side
;;;; is CNA's: a seekable, readable-and-writable object with eleven routes of its
;;;; own, and the first such object to cross this boundary.
;;;;
;;;; Answering a second, parallel stream-like API -- a class with `read-bytes'
;;;; and `write-bytes' of its own -- would have been easy and would have made the
;;;; statement above false. So this is a **real Common Lisp stream**, built on
;;;; Gray streams, and the ordinary vocabulary works on it:
;;;;
;;;;   (read-sequence buffer stream)      (write-sequence buffer stream)
;;;;   (read-byte stream nil :eof)        (write-byte 65 stream)
;;;;   (file-position stream)             (file-position stream 128)
;;;;   (file-position stream :end)        (force-output stream)
;;;;   (close stream)                     (with-open-stream (s ...) ...)
;;;;
;;;; **`FILE-LENGTH' is not among them, and that is the Gray protocol's limit
;;;; rather than a choice.** `CL:FILE-LENGTH' takes a *file stream* and there is
;;;; no Gray generic behind it, so no portable stream class can answer it. The
;;;; length is reached the way it is reached on any other non-file stream:
;;;; `(file-position stream :end)', which is `cna_storage_stream_seek' with the
;;;; END origin and answers the same number `cna_storage_stream_get_length'
;;;; would. That route is bound and unused for exactly this reason.
;;;;
;;;; **The dependency is `trivial-gray-streams', and it is not the thing the
;;;; `cffi-libffi' refusal was about.** That refusal is recorded as being about
;;;; *load-time requirements*: "a released binding needs neither" libffi headers
;;;; nor a C compiler. `trivial-gray-streams' is a few hundred lines of portable
;;;; Common Lisp with no foreign code, no toolchain and no build step, so it
;;;; costs a released binding nothing that the policy is protecting.
;;;;
;;;; --- what a CNA stream is, and is not --------------------------------------
;;;;
;;;; It is an **owned child of its container**: `cna_storage_container_create_file'
;;;; and the three open routes answer an owned handle, and the header says "the
;;;; stream is a child of its container and must be closed before the container is
;;;; destroyed". `cna_storage_stream_close' is the release, so `CL:CLOSE' is what
;;;; calls it and the ownership graph is Container -> Stream.
;;;;
;;;; It reports its own capabilities -- `can_read', `can_write', `can_seek' -- and
;;;; those are what `INPUT-STREAM-P' and friends answer, rather than a guess made
;;;; from the `FileAccess' the caller asked for.

**An ordinary binary stream**, which is the whole point: `READ-SEQUENCE',
`WRITE-SEQUENCE', `READ-BYTE', `WRITE-BYTE', `FILE-POSITION', `FORCE-OUTPUT',
`CLOSE' and `WITH-OPEN-STREAM' all work. `FILE-LENGTH' does not, because
`CL:FILE-LENGTH' takes a file stream and the Gray protocol has no generic behind
it; `(file-position stream :end)' is the length. `System.IO.Stream' is
not a projected type here and never was; a Common Lisp stream is what it becomes.

It is an **owned child of its container** and must be closed before the container
is disposed, which CNA requires and this binding enforces through the ordinary
ownership graph. `CLOSE' releases it. **Disposing the container does not**:
ownership here never cascades, so a container that still owns an open stream
refuses disposal with a `CNA-OWNERSHIP-ERROR' naming what is still live. Close
the streams, then the container, then the device.

Whether it can be read, written or sought is **CNA's answer**, read when the
stream opened, rather than a guess from the `FileAccess' that was asked for."))

**Both steps go in the construction ledger**, which is the reason they are here

happen after the handle is taken, and a construction that failed at the second of
them would otherwise leave a live stream registered on a container the caller
never received one from -- and a container that then refuses disposal forever,
because it owns a child nobody can reach. The ledger runs newest-first, so the
registration is withdrawn and then the handle is closed.

**The undo path is not reachable through the public API**, and that is stated
rather than implied by an untested branch sitting here quietly. A stream is only
ever built by `CREATE-FILE' and `OPEN-FILE', which name the class themselves, so
the exploding-subclass case `tests/native/construction-atomicity.lisp' covers for
every publicly constructible type cannot arise; and the three flag routes answer
`CNA_RESULT_INVALID_ARGUMENT' only for a null output or an invalid handle, on a
handle CNA has just returned. It is here because it is what every other adoption
in this binding does -- `%ADOPT-SONG', `%ADOPT-SOUND-EFFECT', `%ADOPT-BUFFER' --
