;;;; model.lisp --- the Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics Model family.
;;;;
;;;; Twelve types and forty-eight members, and the closure adds nothing: every
;;;; XNA type this family reaches -- Effect, Matrix, BoundingSphere,
;;;; VertexBuffer, IndexBuffer, GraphicsDevice -- was already selected.
;;;;
;;;; **None of these types has a public constructor**, and that is the pinned
;;;; contract rather than a decision made here: `Model..ctor', `ModelBone..ctor',
;;;; `ModelMesh..ctor', `ModelMeshPart..ctor' and every collection's constructor
;;;; are `assembly' in the disassembly, so a program reaches them only through
;;;; `ContentManager.Load<Model>'. CNA does have `cna_model_create*', and this
;;;; file uses those routes to build fixtures for its own tests -- but a private
;;;; fixture producer is not public API, and none of them is projected.
;;;;
;;;; ## Object identity is the hard part, and it is why the graph is eager
;;;;
;;;; **CNA handle identity is not XNA object identity.** `CreateBoneHandle' in
;;;; CNA's own source makes a *new* registry handle on every call, so
;;;; `cna_model_bone_collection_get_at(bones, 0)' twice answers two different
;;;; handles naming one bone. XNA's `Bones[0]' twice answers the same object, and
;;;; `mesh.ParentBone' is that object rather than a copy of it.
;;;;
;;;; So the whole graph is read once, at construction, into a fixed vector per
;;;; collection, and everything that names a bone -- a parent, a child, a mesh's
;;;; parent bone, the root -- is resolved through the model's index map to the
;;;; one object for that bone. A transient handle read on the way is destroyed
;;;; immediately; only the handles the objects keep are recorded.
;;;;
;;;; Effects and buffers are resolved differently, because they may already have
;;;; a CLOS object: a hand-built model's effect is the caller's own, and
;;;; `part.Effect' must answer *that* object. So a handle is looked up among the
;;;; game's live children first, and only a handle nothing owns yet gets a
;;;; model-owned wrapper. CNA's loader publishes one handle per distinct native
;;;; object -- its `published' map is keyed on the native pointer -- so two parts
;;;; sharing one effect answer one object either way.
;;;;
;;;; ## Ownership
;;;;
;;;; The model owns every handle it took, in one ledger, released newest-first
;;;; -- which is leaf-first, because a collection view is always taken before the
;;;; elements read out of it. Bones, meshes and parts are NATIVE-OBJECTs so that
;;;; using one after its model is gone refuses rather than reaching a reissued
;;;; handle, and none of them is disposable, because none of XNA's is.
;;;;
;;;; A **content-loaded** model's effect and buffer handles are the model's, not
;;;; the caller's: `cna_content_manager_load_model' says "the handles this route
;;;; creates for them are released when the model is destroyed -- do not release
;;;; them by hand", and CNA marks such an effect `disposeAllowed = false`. The
;;;; wrappers this file makes for them are therefore `:PARENT-OWNED', which is
;;;; the ownership kind whose DISPOSE already refuses and says to dispose the
;;;; parent. Nothing here fakes ownership in either direction.

;;; 2. **Two refusals are part of the contract.** A null effect and an effect
;;;    that is not `IEffectMatrices' are each an `InvalidOperationException` with
;;;    its own resource string, thrown *before* anything is drawn. Nothing says
;;;    CNA's route produces them.
;;; 3. `cna_model_draw' takes three `CNA_Matrix' by value -- three MEMORY-class
;;;    64-byte aggregates -- so binding it at all would need a fourth shimmed
;;;    route for no gain.
;;;

process and grows it when a model has more bones. A fresh array per call is used
here instead: the static is not observable, it is not thread-safe, and the
allocation it saves is one array per frame.

**Needs the optional private shim**, because assigning `World', `View' and
`Projection' does: `cna_effect_matrices_set_*' take `CNA_Matrix' by value. Without

**`part.Draw()' is inside the pass loop**, so a part with two passes is submitted
twice. That is XNA's, not a transcription slip, and it is what makes a multi-pass
effect draw at all.

`ModelMeshPart.Draw' itself is `assembly' in XNA and is not a member of this
contract. What it does is reproduced here out of the public device surface:

    if NumVertices <= 0: nothing
    device = VertexBuffer.GraphicsDevice
    device.SetVertexBuffer(VertexBuffer, VertexOffset)
    device.Indices = IndexBuffer
    device.DrawIndexedPrimitives(TriangleList, 0, 0, NumVertices, StartIndex, PrimitiveCount)

-- baseVertex and minVertexIndex both zero, and the primitive type a literal
`TriangleList', all three read straight off the IL.

Sets no matrices, so unlike DRAW-MODEL it needs no shim."))
