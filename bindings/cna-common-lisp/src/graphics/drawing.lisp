;;;; drawing.lisp --- VertexBufferBinding, the device's buffer state, and the
;;;; primitive draw calls.
;;;;
;;;; XNA validates its draw arguments before it reaches the driver, and the
;;;; checks are not the ones CNA makes: `DrawPrimitives' refuses a
;;;; `primitiveCount' that is not positive with an ArgumentOutOfRangeException
;;;; naming the parameter, `DrawIndexedPrimitives' refuses `numVertices' the same
;;;; way, and both refuse to run at all while a vertex stream is bound with a
;;;; non-zero instance frequency. Those are reproduced here, from the IL, because
;;;; a binding that forwarded straight to CNA would accept calls XNA rejects and
;;;; report a different failure for the ones it does reject.
;;;;
;;;; What is *not* reproduced: XNA's profile capability cap on primitive count.
;;;; It is a property of the GraphicsProfile, which is not projected yet, and
;;;; inventing a limit would be worse than letting CNA answer.
