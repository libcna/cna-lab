;;;; graphics-device.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsDevice.
;;;;
;;;; **One public type, two native lifetimes.** XNA permits both and CNA supplies
;;;; both, and the whole shape of this file is keeping them behind one
;;;; `GraphicsDevice' rather than two classes a consumer would have to choose
;;;; between. `%DEVICE-LIFETIME-MODE' names which one an instance has:
;;;;
;;;;   :PARENT-OWNED   the game's device. CNA lends it only from inside a
;;;;                   lifecycle callback and the borrowed handle is valid only
;;;;                   until that callback returns, so this mode stores **no
;;;;                   handle at all** and resolves a fresh one per operation.
;;;;                   Keeping the borrowed handle in a slot would be the classic
;;;;                   bug: it would look like it worked, right up to the first
;;;;                   use after the frame that produced it. An operation
;;;;                   attempted outside a callback is refused with a
;;;;                   CNA-SCOPE-ERROR before anything reaches the ABI, and the
;;;;                   caller may not dispose it -- the game owns it.
;;;;
;;;;   :OWNED          a device the caller made with XNA's own constructor,
;;;;                   outside any game. It holds a persistent handle from
;;;;                   `cna_graphics_device_create', needs no callback scope, is
;;;;                   disposed by the caller, and owns its own graphics
;;;;                   resources rather than lending the game's.
;;;;
;;;; `%RESOLVE-DEVICE-HANDLE' is the single seam between the two: every member
;;;; below goes through it and none of them knows which mode it has. The two
;;;; places where XNA's *own* behaviour differs -- `Adapter' and
;;;; `PresentationParameters', which an owned device can answer exactly from what
;;;; its constructor was given and a facade can only approximate from CNA -- say
;;;; so at the member rather than here.
;;;;
;;;; Everything CNA does under a caller-created device was measured before any of
;;;; this was written; `tools/qualification/owned-device-matrix.sh' is that
;;;; measurement and `docs/compatibility.md' records what it found.

legal only inside a game lifecycle method -- LOAD-CONTENT, UPDATE, DRAW and their

two native ownership graphs under XNA's one public hierarchy:

    game   -> borrowed device facade -> the game's graphics resources
    caller -> owned device           -> that device's graphics resources

For the facade the owner is the *game*: CNA requires every graphics resource
destroyed before `cna_game_destroy' succeeds, so the game is what has to know
about them. For an owned device the owner is the *device*, and the measurement
says CNA means it -- `cna_graphics_device_get_tracked_resource_count' rises and
falls per device, and `cna_game_destroy' succeeds with an owned device and its
resources still live.

Every native graphics resource derives its owner through this function rather
than reaching for the game itself, so no resource family can be left behind when
a second kind of device appears. Pretending an owned device has a game parent
would be the same bug in the other direction: the game would then gate resources
it does not own."

this closure added -- **the public GRAPHICS-DEVICE object it was made from**.

That last one is `GraphicsResource::_parent' in the pinned IL, which
`get_GraphicsDevice' returns with a bare `ldfld'. Before there were owned
devices the binding could get away with answering the active game's facade,

`GraphicsAdapter', and a program with no game has no way to obtain one -- which
is the loop this breaks. `cna_graphics_device_create' takes an adapter *index*,
not an object, and index zero is valid whenever the runtime is up, so a device
made on it can answer the enumeration that produces the real adapter objects.

Deliberately not the public constructor: there is no adapter to hand it, and
building one would be the loop again. Deliberately not exposed, cached or
reused either -- it is created, asked, and disposed inside one call, and twenty
such rounds were measured at 53 milliseconds. Its presentation parameters are
