;;;; graphics-adapter.lisp --- GraphicsAdapter and DisplayModeCollection.
;;;;
;;;; **Every adapter route takes a callback-scoped graphics-device handle**, and
;;;; that is the one thing to know before reading anything else here. XNA's
;;;; `GraphicsAdapter.Adapters` and `.DefaultAdapter` are *static* and answer
;;;; before a device exists -- that is how an XNA program chooses the adapter it
;;;; then creates a device on. CNA has no adapter query that does not go through a
;;;; device, so here the same members need a live game **and** a lifecycle
;;;; callback to be inside.
;;;;
;;;; That is a real divergence and it is recorded as one: the two static members
;;;; are reported **partial**, and the reason names the scope rather than
;;;; describing the members as complete and leaving a caller to discover it. The
;;;; instance members are complete, because reading an adapter's description
;;;; inside a draw is exactly as available here as it is there.
;;;;
;;;; An adapter holds **no handle**. CNA identifies one by a zero-based index into
;;;; its own enumeration, so this class holds that index and the game to ask
;;;; through, and every reader resolves the borrowed device handle per call --
;;;; which is also what makes the scope rule enforce itself rather than needing a
;;;; check of its own.

neither `Equals' nor `GetHashCode' in the pinned Graphics assembly, and
`GraphicsDeviceInformation.Equals' compares adapters with `Object.Equals' -- so
in XNA that comparison is *reference* equality, and it works because
`GraphicsAdapter.Adapters' is a static `ReadOnlyCollection' built once:
`get_Adapters' is `ldsfld pAdapterList; ret' and `get_DefaultAdapter' is
`pAdapterList[0]'. Handing out a fresh object per query, which this binding did
until the services closure needed adapter identity, made every such comparison
false.

never invalidated; this one is scoped to the game because an adapter here holds
