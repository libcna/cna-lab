;;;; graphics-resource.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsResource.
;;;;
;;;; The abstract base of every graphics object XNA owns: a name, a tag, the
;;;; device it belongs to, whether it has been disposed, and an event raised
;;;; while it is being disposed.
;;;;
;;;; **The public hierarchy is not the native ownership hierarchy.** That is the
;;;; whole shape of this file, and getting it wrong is what it was written to
;;;; correct. The pinned contract says `BlendState', `DepthStencilState',
;;;; `RasterizerState', `SamplerState', `VertexDeclaration', `Texture' and
;;;; `SpriteBatch' all have `baseType` GraphicsResource. Five of those hold no
;;;; CNA handle at all -- CNA models a state object and a vertex declaration as
;;;; versioned descriptors, with no create route and nothing to destroy. An
;;;; earlier version of this binding concluded from that that they could not be
;;;; GraphicsResources. That was wrong, and the assembly says why:
;;;;
;;;;   GraphicsResource::get_Name reads the *device's* cache when
;;;;   `_internalHandle != 0' and its own `_localName' field otherwise.
;;;;
;;;; XNA already has the handle-less case, in the base class, by design. `Tag',
;;;; `IsDisposed' and `Disposing' are ordinary managed fields; `GraphicsDevice'
;;;; is `_parent', which is **null until the resource is applied to a device**
;;;; and is set by `Apply'. None of it needs a handle.
;;;;
;;;; So the hierarchy has one public root and two private branches:
;;;;
;;;;     graphics-resource                 public, no native anything
;;;;       %managed-graphics-resource      local name, local disposal
;;;;         %state-object -> the four states
;;;;         vertex-declaration
;;;;       %native-graphics-resource       + NATIVE-OBJECT: handle, generation,
;;;;         texture -> texture-2d           owner thread, parent/child
;;;;         sprite-batch
;;;;
;;;; Two branches, one disposal mechanism each, no diamond and no fabricated
;;;; handle. A managed-only resource never pretends to have one.
;;;;
;;;; Two projection decisions, unchanged from before the split.
;;;;
;;;; **`IsDisposed' and `Dispose()' are the ones CNA-Lisp already had.** Every
;;;; object in this binding carries deterministic disposal, so this type does not
;;;; introduce a second mechanism: `IsDisposed' *is* DISPOSED-P and `Dispose()'
;;;; *is* DISPOSE, and the rules record that rather than inventing a
;;;; `graphics-resource-dispose'.
;;;;
;;;; **`Tag' is kept on the Lisp side.** XNA's Tag is `System.Object' -- arbitrary
;;;; consumer data the framework never reads. CNA's is a `uint64' token, which
;;;; cannot hold a Lisp object and could only hold a pointer to one, and putting a
;;;; pointer to a moving object into C is the one thing this binding never does.
;;;; So the tag is a slot, it holds any Lisp object, and it is not round-tripped
;;;; through the C ABI. A consumer that shares a resource with another CNA
;;;; binding would not see that binding's tag; nothing in CNA-Lisp does.

device it was applied to.

A resource with a handle answers **the device object it was created against**,
which is the same field on the same branch: whichever GRAPHICS-DEVICE its
constructor, its content loader or its decoder was handed.

That is a sentence this file could not write until there was more than one
device. Before caller-owned devices existed, this method looked up the *active
game* and answered its facade, and the answer was right for the only reason that
it could not be wrong -- a program had one device and that was it. With two
kinds of device the lookup is wrong for one of them and, worse, wrong silently:
a resource made on a device of your own would have reported the game's. So the
resource remembers the object, which is also what the IL does -- `_parent', read
by `get_GraphicsDevice' with a bare `ldfld' and no lookup of any kind.

caller-owned device answers correctly in a process with no game in it at all."))
