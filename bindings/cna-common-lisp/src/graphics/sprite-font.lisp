;;;; sprite-font.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteFont.
;;;;
;;;; Six public members -- `LineSpacing', `Spacing', `DefaultCharacter',
;;;; `Characters' and the two `MeasureString' overloads -- and four decisions
;;;; behind them that the pinned assembly, not CNA, settled.
;;;;
;;;; **SpriteFont is not a GraphicsResource and is not IDisposable.** The
;;;; contract says `baseType System.Object', the assembly says `sealed ...
;;;; extends [mscorlib]System.Object', and there is no `Dispose' anywhere on it.
;;;; CNA nevertheless hands out an *owned* handle that must be given back. Those
;;;; are two different questions and this file answers them separately: the public
;;;; shape is XNA's, and the handle is released through the binding's own
;;;; DISPOSE, which is a declared CNA-Lisp extension on every native object and
;;;; not an XNA member of this type. See `docs/ownership-and-lifetimes.md'.
;;;;
;;;; **There is no public constructor, so this file exposes none.** XNA's `.ctor'
;;;; is `assembly'-visible: a consumer obtains a SpriteFont from
;;;; `ContentManager.Load<SpriteFont>' and from nowhere else. CNA does have
;;;; `cna_sprite_font_create', and projecting it as a public constructor would
;;;; invent a member XNA has not got. `%MAKE-SPRITE-FONT-FROM-GLYPHS' is
;;;; unexported and exists so the closure can be tested before the content
;;;; closure lands; `docs/limitations.md' records that a consumer therefore
;;;; cannot yet obtain one.
;;;;
;;;; **Measurement and drawing are computed here, from the glyph table, not asked
;;;; of CNA.** CNA has `cna_sprite_font_measure_utf8' and
;;;; `cna_sprite_batch_draw_string' and this binding calls neither for its answer,
;;;; for the same reason the value types do their own arithmetic: a runtime cannot
;;;; be the oracle for its own compatibility, and routing layout through CNA would
;;;; make the layout CNA's rather than XNA's, leaving nothing to cross-check. Two
;;;; concrete things follow. The algorithms below are transcribed instruction by
;;;; instruction from `SpriteFont::InternalMeasure' and `SpriteFont::InternalDraw'
;;;; in the pinned `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.dll'. And the projected input
;;;; domain stays XNA's: CNA's two routes take **UTF-8**, which cannot encode an
;;;; unpaired surrogate, while a `System.String' can hold one and this can measure
;;;; one. `cna_sprite_font_measure_utf8' is bound anyway, and
;;;; `tests/native/sprite-font.lisp' cross-checks it against this file over the
;;;; text where both domains agree -- as a comparison, never as an authority.
;;;;
;;;; **A glyph is looked up by UTF-16 code unit.** `System.Char' is sixteen bits
;;;; with all 65536 values legal, so it projects onto an integer in [0, 65535]
;;;; rather than onto CHARACTER, and a string is converted to code units before
;;;; anything is measured. `src/internal/utf16.lisp' has the derivation.

character drawn.

Four vectors rather than one vector of structures, because that is what XNA has
-- `glyphData', `croppingData', `characterMap' and `kerning', indexed in
lockstep -- and because the measurement transcription indexes them exactly that
way.

**A generic function on unspecialised arguments, and deliberately.** This step
runs after both of the load's native handles exist and after the atlas has been
adopted, which makes it the exact window a failure-injection test has to be able
to open -- the same reason %READ-TEXTURE-STORAGE is a generic function. There is

it cannot mask the failure that caused it."

;;; Both setters in the assembly are a bare `stfld'. There is no validation of
;;; any kind: XNA accepts a negative LineSpacing, a zero one, and a Spacing that
;;; is NaN or either infinity, and stores exactly what it was given. None of that
;;; is added here, because adding it would refuse programs XNA runs.
;;;
;;; CNA is stricter -- `cna_sprite_font_set_spacing' documents "Must be finite"
;;; -- and that is precisely why these are managed fields rather than write-through
;;; to the native font. XNA's are managed fields too: `InternalMeasure' and
;;; `InternalDraw' read them from the object, and nothing native reads them here
;;; either, because both algorithms are computed in this file. So the three CNA
;;; setters are deliberately not bound at all. `docs/limitations.md' records the
;;; divergence and what it means for the native font's own view.

  a line, so \"A\\r\\nB\" and \"A\\nB\" measure the same;

  Spacing nor the previous glyph's right bearing;

  once at the end of each line and once at the end of the string, so a negative
