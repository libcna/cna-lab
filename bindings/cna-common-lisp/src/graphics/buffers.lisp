;;;; buffers.lisp --- VertexBuffer, IndexBuffer and their dynamic subclasses.
;;;;
;;;; These are GraphicsResources with real CNA handles, so they are on the
;;;; %NATIVE-GRAPHICS-RESOURCE branch and get the whole ownership machinery:
;;;; owner thread, generation, parent/child registration and deterministic
;;;; destruction, children destroyed before the game.
;;;;
;;;; Three things about the mapping are worth stating.
;;;;
;;;; **A VertexDeclaration is copied into the buffer, so the handle is
;;;; transient.** CNA's create route takes a CNA_VertexDeclarationHandle and its
;;;; header says the declaration is *copied* into the buffer. CNA-Lisp's
;;;; VERTEX-DECLARATION is a managed-only GraphicsResource with no handle, so the
;;;; constructor builds a native declaration from the elements, hands it over and
;;;; destroys it immediately. Nothing native outlives the call, and the buffer's
;;;; own VertexDeclaration property answers the Lisp object it was given -- which
;;;; is what XNA's answers.
;;;;
;;;; **All transfer goes through the raw routes.** CNA has a typed path keyed on
;;;; its seven built-in vertex identities, and using it would mean the four
;;;; standard vertex types went one way and everything else another. The raw
;;;; routes take bytes, a count and a stride, and src/graphics/buffer-data.lisp
;;;; packs the bytes from a layout it can prove -- so one path serves the
;;;; standard types, the scalar types and an octet vector a caller packed
;;;; themselves, and an element type with no proven layout is refused rather
;;;; than written.
;;;;
;;;; **IsContentLost is a real read of a value CNA never sets.** CNA_VertexBufferInfo
;;;; documents its is_content_lost field as "currently always false". The
;;;; property reads it rather than returning a literal, so a future CNA that does
;;;; report loss is reported here without a change; and docs/limitations.md
;;;; records that today the answer is always false and ContentLost never fires.
