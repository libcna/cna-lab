;;;; render-target-cube.lisp --- RenderTargetCube and RenderTargetBinding.
;;;;
;;;; The last of the render-target family, and the pair that closes
;;;; `GraphicsDevice`'s three remaining render-target members.
;;;;
;;;; `RenderTargetCube' is to `TextureCube' what `RenderTarget2D' is to
;;;; `Texture2D': the same type with its own creation route and its own destroy,
;;;; so a finished target is an ordinary cube that an effect can sample. Both are
;;;; derived from the texture rather than wrapping it, because that is what XNA's
;;;; base types say.
;;;;
;;;; `RenderTargetBinding' is a **value type** -- XNA derives it from
;;;; `System.ValueType' -- so it projects as a struct, like `Rectangle' or
;;;; `Viewport', and not as a native object. It holds a target and, for a cube,
;;;; the face being drawn into.
;;;;
;;;; **`GetRenderTargets' answers the objects this binding bound.**
;;;; `cna_graphics_device_copy_render_targets' answers *handles*, and the ABI has
;;;; no route from a handle back to the CLOS object that owns it. So the device
;;;; remembers what was bound and this cross-checks CNA's count and handles
;;;; against that record rather than inventing objects to wrap handles it already
;;;; has objects for. The same decision the vertex-buffer bindings record, for the
;;;; same reason.

Answers the RENDER-TARGET-BINDING values this binding bound, **cross-checked**

they have to: `cna_graphics_device_copy_render_targets' answers handles, and the
ABI has no route from a handle back to the object that owns it, so wrapping them
would invent second objects for targets this program already has.

Everything CNA *can* be asked is checked against the record, and a disagreement
signals rather than being papered over. That is four things, because a binding's
identity is more than its target handle:

* the **count** `cna_graphics_device_get_render_target_count' reports;
* the **written count** the copy route reports, which is the exact required
  element count -- a copy that wrote fewer elements than the count promised would
  otherwise leave the rest of the array reading as zeroed bindings;
* every slot's **target handle**, in order, so a swapped pair is caught;
* every slot's **cube map face**, which is the half of a cube binding's identity
  the handle does not carry. A 2D binding's face is positive X -- XNA's own
  constructor stores it -- and CNA says the same of a 2D target, \"meaningless for
  a 2D target and must then be positive X\", so every slot is cross-checked and
  none is skipped.

The array slice is checked to be zero as well, which is what CNA requires of it
in both directions.

An empty list is XNA's empty array: the back buffer is current."))
