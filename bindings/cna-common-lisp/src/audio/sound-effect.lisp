;;;; **XNA's constructors take no game, and neither do these.** CNA's creation
;;;; routes all take one -- `cna_sound_effect_create_pcm16_range_ext' takes a game
;;;; handle "for lifetime and creation-thread scope" -- and the gap is closed the
;;;; way `Keyboard.GetState' closes it: CNA permits one active game per process,
;;;; so there is exactly one game a constructor could mean, and CNA-Lisp resolves
;;;; it. Adding a `:game' initarg would change XNA's public API to accommodate
;;;; CNA, which is the one thing this projection does not do.
;;;;
;;;; **The validation is XNA's, transcribed from the IL, and the order matters.**
;;;; Every check below is `SoundEffect.FromBuffer' in the pinned assembly, in the
;;;; order that method performs them, because which exception a doubly-invalid
;;;; call gets is decided by the order. CNA validates too, and differently -- it
;;;; would answer `CNA_RESULT_INVALID_ARGUMENT' for most of these -- so the checks
;;;; run *before* the route rather than being inferred from it. Where the two
;;;; disagree, XNA wins publicly and `docs/limitations.md' records the difference.
;;;;
;;;; **One divergence worth naming here, because it is CNA's header that is
;;;; wrong about XNA.** `cna_sound_effect_play' documents "A disposed effect
;;;; answers `CNA_FALSE' rather than failing, which is the canonical behavior".
;;;; It is not: `SoundEffect.Play' opens with an `IsDisposed' test and throws
;;;; `ObjectDisposedException'. CNA-Lisp's disposal check runs first and signals
;;;; `CNA-DISPOSED-ERROR', so the public behaviour is XNA's and the route's
;;;; `CNA_FALSE' branch is never reached from here.

(defun sound-effect-from-stream (stream)
  "SoundEffect.FromStream(Stream).

STREAM is an ordinary Common Lisp binary stream, which is what `System.IO.Stream'
projects onto here -- see `docs/limitations.md'. XNA reads it to the end;
`cna_sound_effect_create_from_encoded_ext' takes the bytes CNA would have read,
because \"the canonical operation takes a C++ stream and reads it to the end, so C
takes the bytes it would have read\".

**The bytes are checked against XNA's wave contract before CNA sees them, and
that is the whole point of `audio/wave.lisp'.** CNA's route accepts \"whatever the
audio backend can decode ... which is more than the raw PCM the other creation
routes take\" -- its own header says so -- and XNA accepts one shape: a RIFF/WAVE
file whose `fmt ' chunk declares uncompressed PCM, one or two channels, 8 or 16
bits and a rate in [8000, 48000], followed by a `data' chunk. Handing an Ogg
straight to CNA and answering with a SoundEffect because SDL could decode it
would be adding a capability to `FromStream' that XNA has not got, which is the
one thing this projection does not do.

**Three different failures, three different conditions.** They used to be one:

  not RIFF/WAVE, or a declared size that disagrees with the stream
      CNA-USAGE-ERROR, XNA's InvalidOperationException from ParseWavHeader

  a wave file XNA will not read -- non-PCM, wrong channel count, wrong rate,
  wrong sample width, no fmt chunk, no data chunk, data before fmt
      CNA-ARGUMENT-ERROR, XNA's ArgumentException(InvalidWaveStream)

  a wave file XNA accepts, on a machine with no playback device
      NO-AUDIO-HARDWARE-ERROR, XNA's NoAudioHardwareException

The third used to swallow the other two, because `CNA_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED' is
the code for \"no audio hardware\" *and* for \"cannot decode these bytes\", and
mapping both onto NO-AUDIO-HARDWARE-ERROR told a program with a malformed asset
that its machine had no sound card. Validating first removes the ambiguity, and
what remains of it is settled by asking CNA whether a playback device exists."

has not got, and each of them used to be accepted here: the method decided it had
been given the long overload from whether `:VOLUME' was supplied, and defaulted
the other two to 0.0. `Play()' *is* `Play(1f, 0f, 0f)' -- that is its whole body
in the pinned IL -- but that makes the no-argument form a shorthand for the full
triple, not a licence for the six shapes between them.")

One generic function with an optional settings triple, because XNA gives the two
overloads one name and the no-argument form is exactly `Play(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)' --
which is what its IL does, and what this does when no settings are given. The
triple is all-or-nothing; see *SOUND-EFFECT-PLAY-OVERLOADS*.

Answers T when playback started and NIL when it did not. A disposed effect
signals `CNA-DISPOSED-ERROR' rather than answering NIL: CNA's route documents the
`CNA_FALSE' answer as canonical and it is not -- `SoundEffect.Play' opens with an
`IsDisposed' test and throws. See the file header.

`INSTANCE-PLAY-LIMIT-ERROR' is signalled when the platform's voice limit is
reached, which is XNA's `InstancePlayLimitException'.

**All three values are range-checked, and that is read from the IL rather than
inferred.** `Play(float, float, float)' performs no validation of its own: its
body takes an instance from the pool and calls `set_Volume', `set_Pitch' and
`set_Pan' on it, in that order, before `Play()'. So the rules are exactly those
three setters' -- volume in [0, 1], pitch in [-1, 1], pan in [-1, 1], each
comparing with `blt.un'/`bgt.un' so that a NaN takes the throwing branch -- and
the *order* is theirs too, which decides which parameter a doubly-invalid call is
told about. This previously checked `pan' only and documented pitch as clamped;
that was CNA's behaviour rather than XNA's, and CNA's clamp is exactly why the

(defmethod xna::dispose-owned-children ((effect sound-effect) children)
  "SoundEffect.Dispose disposes its live instances, and this is the one type that does.

**Read from the pinned IL, not from the documentation sentence about it.**
`SoundEffect.Dispose(bool)' sets its own `disposed' field, takes a snapshot of its
`children' list, and calls `Dispose()' on every weak reference in it that is still
a live `SoundEffectInstance' -- then drains its instance pool the same way, and
only then releases its own native handle. So the observable behaviour after

    effect = ...;  instance = effect.CreateInstance();  effect.Dispose();

is: `effect.IsDisposed' is true, `instance.IsDisposed' is **also** true, and every
member of the instance that opens with an `IsDisposed' test -- `State',
`Play', `Pause', `Resume', `Stop', `Apply3D' and the three settings' setters --
throws `ObjectDisposedException'. The three *getters* do not: `get_Volume',
`get_Pitch' and `get_Pan' are a bare `ldfld' with no check, and answer the last
value stored. Disposing the instance afterwards is legal and does nothing, because
`SoundEffectInstance.Dispose(bool)' returns early when already disposed.

`CNA-DISPOSED-ERROR' is this binding's `ObjectDisposedException', and it is what
the instance's operations answer here for the same reason.

**The child order is CNA's requirement and XNA's behaviour at once.** Each
instance's voice is deallocated before the effect's handle is released, which is
the \"destroyed after all instances created from it and before the game\" ordering
CNA documents -- so reproducing XNA here does not fight the ABI, it satisfies it.

DISPOSE is used rather than a private teardown so that one instance failing to
release cannot leave the rest alive: each child goes through the same idempotent,
ledger-aware path a program's own `(dispose instance)' would.

**The failure policy, stated rather than inherited.** A `SoundEffect''s children
are dependent native children, not the independent assets `ContentManager.Unload'
walks, so the policy is decided here on this type's own evidence:

1. every live instance is attempted, in the recorded child-before-parent order;
2. the **first** condition is kept and no later one replaces it;
3. a child that signalled does not stop the ones after it -- which is the property
   this docstring claimed while a bare `DOLIST' was refuting it, since the first
   signal left the loop and every later instance stayed alive;
4. if any child signalled, the condition is re-signalled from here, which is
   **before** `DISPOSE''s own `UNWIND-PROTECT'. The effect is therefore left
   undisposed and a retry can release it once the children are gone.

Step 4 is the conservative half and it is conservative on purpose.
`cna_sound_effect_instance_destroy' documents its return as `CNA_RESULT_SUCCESS'
or a documented handle, thread or native failure, and says the
handle is invalid when the function returns; it does **not** say that a failing
call has nevertheless released the native instance, and a handle failure plainly
has not. Destroying the effect over a child CNA may still be holding is the one
outcome the ownership graph exists to prevent, so a reported child failure stops
the parent rather than being logged past.

What a failed child does *not* leave behind is a Lisp-side inconsistency: DISPOSE
invalidates through an `UNWIND-PROTECT', so a child whose native destroy failed is
still marked disposed, still unregistered from this effect and still off the
instance list. The leftover check below therefore stays exact."

*that*, before the multiplication by 10000. It is round-half-away-from-zero to a
whole millisecond, not to a whole tick, and the result is therefore always a
multiple of 10000 ticks.

**This was previously computed as `(long)(v * 10000 + 0.5)', and that is a
different number.** 12.5 ms is 130000 ticks in XNA and 125000 under the old

buffer holds\", which is true of the buffer and false of `TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds'.
XNA quantises to whole milliseconds here just as CNA's route does -- what the two
disagree about is the direction, CNA truncating 12.5 to 12 and XNA rounding it to
13 -- so the divergence is one rounding rule rather than a lost precision, and
`tests/native/audio.lisp' pins all three numbers.

;;; --- the four process-wide statics -----------------------------------------

;;; XNA's are `static' properties over `static' fields, and CNA's routes are
;;; process-wide too: its header calls them "canonical **statics**: they belong to
;;; the process, not to a sound effect, and the game handle is taken for thread
;;; affinity only". So the game the value is read through does not own it, and the
;;; projection is four `SETF'-able package functions, which is what the naming
;;; rule makes a static member of a non-static class.
;;;
;;; The validation is XNA's and each of the four is different. Read from the IL,
;;; and the NaN answers are the part worth stating, because three of the four
;;; compare with an *unordered* branch and one does not:
;;;
;;;   MasterVolume   [0, 1]     NaN throws     (blt.un / bgt.un to the throw)
;;;   DopplerScale   [0, inf)   NaN throws     (blt.un to the throw)
;;;   SpeedOfSound   (0, inf)   NaN throws     (ble.un to the throw)
;;;   DistanceScale  [0, inf)   NaN **stored** (bge.un to the accepting branch)
;;;
;;; and DistanceScale alone then clamps: a value at or below `float.Epsilon'
;;; becomes `float.Epsilon', because a zero distance scale would divide by zero
;;; in the attenuation. A test pins all four, NaN included.
