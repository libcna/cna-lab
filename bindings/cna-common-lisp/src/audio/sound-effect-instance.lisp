;;;; sound-effect-instance.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.SoundEffectInstance.
;;;;
;;;; A controllable playback of a `SoundEffect', and a native child of it. CNA's
;;;; `cna_sound_effect_create_instance' says the relation plainly -- "an
;;;; explicitly ordered C child: destroy it before its sound effect. It also
;;;; remains a child of the game that owns the effect" -- so the ownership graph
;;;; is `Game -> SoundEffect -> SoundEffectInstance', and this binding enforces
;;;; it before the ABI does.
;;;;
;;;; **`SoundEffectInstance' is the one audio class XNA does not seal.**
;;;; `DynamicSoundEffectInstance' derives from it. That subclass is not in this
;;;; selection, but the shape has to leave room for it, which is why `Dispose(bool)'
;;;; is `not-applicable' rather than projected: Common Lisp has no finalizers here
;;;; by policy, so the disposing/finalizing distinction the protected overload
;;;; exists for has nothing to express.
;;;;
;;;; **Three setters validate, and their bounds are XNA's, not CNA's.** The
;;;; divergence is real and goes both ways:
;;;;
;;;;   Volume   XNA refuses outside [0, 1];  CNA passes any finite value through
;;;;   Pitch    XNA refuses outside [-1, 1]; CNA **clamps** to [-1, 1]
;;;;   Pan      XNA refuses outside [-1, 1]; CNA refuses too
;;;;
;;;; so two of the three would silently accept a value XNA throws on. The checks
;;;; therefore run here, before the route. All three use an unordered comparison
;;;; in the IL, so **NaN is refused by all three**.
;;;;
;;;; **"Aim before you play", and it is XNA's rule as much as CNA's.** CNA's
;;;; `apply_3d' refuses an instance that is already playing and was never
;;;; positioned, because the reference implementation submits its audio packet on
;;;; the first play. XNA's own `Pan' setter has the mirror image of that rule: once
;;;; an instance is positioned, `Pan' throws `InvalidOperationException' rather
;;;; than being ignored. Both directions are projected.

   "Acquire INSTANCE's native handle and enter it into its owner's ledger.

**The seam this type is polymorphic at, and it is polymorphic in XNA first.**
`SoundEffectInstance' has two constructors in the pinned assembly: the
assembly-visible `(SoundEffect, bool)' that stores the parent effect and calls
`AllocateVoice()', and a **parameterless** `.ctor()' that stores nothing, calls
nothing and exists for the subclass. `DynamicSoundEffectInstance' calls the
second, validates its own arguments and then calls the same virtual
`AllocateVoice()' -- which it overrides. So the base class's construction already
varies by class in the original, and a base `INITIALIZE-INSTANCE :AFTER' that
always required a `SoundEffect' and always called
`cna_sound_effect_create_instance' would run the wrong constructor for a subclass
that CLOS is perfectly willing to define.

A specialization is responsible for four things and nothing else: validating the
arguments its own XNA constructor takes, calling its own creation route,
choosing its owner, and calling %ADOPT-SOUND-EFFECT-INSTANCE with what it got.
Everything after that -- the handle, the thread affinity, the child registration
and the two undo steps -- is the same for every kind and is not repeated.

Dispatching here rather than testing the class inside one method is the point: a
`TYPEP' ladder in the ordinary constructor would make the ordinary type's
constructor responsible for every future one."))

mixing setters and `cna_sound_effect_instance_destroy'.\" That sentence is
identical in every admitted ABI -- `audio.h' is byte for byte the same in 0.21.0

(defun %instance-managed-settings (instance)
  "Volume, pitch, pan and looping as INSTANCE's managed slots hold them.

**Why these four are slots here and not reads of `cna_sound_effect_instance_get_info'.**
The pinned IL settles it, member by member, and it does not answer the same way
for all six of this type's public getters:

    get_State     104 bytes: takes voiceHandleLock, throws ObjectDisposedException
                  when disposed, then calls the native GetState. **Guarded.**
    get_IsDisposed  7 bytes: ldfld disposed.
    get_Volume      7 bytes: ldfld currentVolume.
    get_Pitch       7 bytes: ldfld currentPitch.
    get_Pan         7 bytes: ldfld currentPan.
    get_IsLooped    7 bytes: ldfld looped.

So `State' is the only one of the six that reads the voice, and the four settings
are bare field reads with no disposal test at all. They keep answering after the
instance is disposed -- including after a `SoundEffect' cascade disposed it -- and
that is observable behaviour rather than an accident: a program may read the
volume of an instance it has finished with.

Reading them through CNA made all four refuse with `CNA-DISPOSED-ERROR` where XNA
answers, because the route needs a handle that is gone. Keeping them here fixes
that and three more things at once:

* **`APPLY-3D` does not write them.** `UnsafeApply3D' stores exactly two fields,
  `is3d' and `listenerData'; it never touches `currentVolume', `currentPitch' or
  `currentPan'. CNA's mixer, on the other hand, computes a spatial pan and a
  Doppler pitch and `get_info' reports those. Answering CNA's numbers would be
  reporting the mixer's state through a property XNA defines as the value the
  caller last assigned.
* **The write happens after the route succeeds, exactly where XNA's does.** Each
  of `set_Volume', `set_Pitch' and `set_Pan' validates, calls its native setter,
  lets `ThrowExceptionFromErrorCode' rethrow, and only then `stfld's the field. A
  refused or failed set therefore leaves the old value readable, and so it does
  here.
* **The defaults are XNA's.** Its constructor sets `currentVolume' to 1 and then
  calls `set_Volume(1)', `set_Pitch(0)', `set_Pan(0)' and stores `looped' false.
  The slots start at those four values, and `tests/native/audio.lisp' pins that a
  freshly created CNA instance reports the same four through `get_info', so the
  managed defaults and the native state agree rather than merely coexisting.

`IS-LOOPED' is here for the same reason and one more: XNA's `set_IsLooped' stores
the field and makes **no** native call -- the flag is read later, in `Play', to
choose the loop count of the packet it submits. CNA needs to be told, so the
setter here does call the route; the value the getter answers is still the
managed one."

**It takes no argument, and this refuses every keyword rather than ignoring it.**
`PLAY' is one generic function shared with `SOUND-EFFECT', whose long overload is
spelled `:VOLUME :PITCH :PAN', and CLOS lambda-list congruence therefore forces
this method to *accept* those three names. Accepting is not having: XNA's
`SoundEffectInstance' has a single `Play()' and three separate properties, so

    (play instance :volume 0.5)

is not a quieter way of setting the volume -- it is a member that does not exist,
and silently discarding the 0.5 would be the worst of the three possible answers.
An instance's volume is set through `(setf (volume instance) 0.5)', which is what
XNA's property is.

The same rule and the same reason as the buffer/texture split in SET-DATA: a
generic function shared between classes must refuse the other class's keywords by
name rather than let congruence turn them into no-ops."

   "SoundEffectInstance.Apply3D(AudioListener, AudioEmitter) and its array overload.

**Two CLR overloads, two CLOS methods**, told apart by the declared type of the
second argument: one `AUDIO-LISTENER', or a sequence of them. That is ordinary
CLOS dispatch rather than a `TYPECASE' inside one method, so the two overloads
stay two things a program can specialise and the projection loses neither.

LISTENERS is one listener or a sequence. A single listener takes
`cna_sound_effect_instance_apply_3d'; a sequence takes `..._apply_3d_multi_ext'.

**An empty sequence is refused**, and that is CNA's decision, adopted: XNA reaches
XACT with a count of zero and surfaces whatever XACT returns, which is not an
established outcome, so a count of zero is a condition here rather than a guess.

**Aim before you play.** An instance that is already playing and was never
positioned is refused by CNA with `CNA_RESULT_INVALID_STATE', because the audio
packet was submitted on the first `PLAY' and the choice between 3D and pan is
fixed for that playback. Position first and then play, or stop, position and play
again.

**What this proves and does not.** A successful call means the values reached CNA
and the route accepted them. It is not a claim about where a human would hear the
sound; no test here makes one. How several listeners combine is CNA's own
approximation -- it evaluates each and lets the **nearest** decide -- and its
header says so; that is not XACT's per-listener output matrix and must not be
described as one."))
