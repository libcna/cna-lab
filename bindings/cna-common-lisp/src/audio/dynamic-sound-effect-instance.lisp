;;;; dynamic-sound-effect-instance.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.DynamicSoundEffectInstance.
;;;;
;;;; A `SoundEffectInstance' the program feeds PCM to, rather than one built from
;;;; a `SoundEffect'. XNA's own type is `sealed' and derives from
;;;; `SoundEffectInstance'; the pinned contract says so, and so does its IL:
;;;;
;;;;     .class public auto ansi sealed
;;;;            Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.DynamicSoundEffectInstance
;;;;            extends Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio.SoundEffectInstance
;;;;
;;;; **It does not construct itself the way its base class does, and that is the
;;;; architectural fact this file exists around.** XNA's `SoundEffectInstance' has
;;;; two constructors: a public-to-the-assembly `(SoundEffect, bool)' that stores
;;;; the parent effect and allocates a voice from it, and a **parameterless**
;;;; `.ctor()' that stores nothing and allocates nothing. `DynamicSoundEffectInstance'
;;;; calls the second, validates its own two arguments, builds an `AudioFormat',
;;;; and only then calls the virtual `AllocateVoice()' -- which it overrides with
;;;; `CreateDynamicSoundEffectInstance'. So the base class's construction is
;;;; *already* polymorphic in the original, and this projection makes it
;;;; polymorphic here too rather than smuggling a `TYPEP' into the base method.
;;;;
;;;; **CNA agrees, and its header is what settles the sharing.**
;;;; `cna_dynamic_sound_effect_instance_create' says of the handle it answers:
;;;;
;;;;     The handle is a **sound-effect instance**: every `cna_sound_effect_instance_*'
;;;;     route accepts it, including the transport, the mixing setters and
;;;;     `cna_sound_effect_instance_destroy'. What this kind adds is the buffer
;;;;     queue below. Unlike an instance created from a sound effect, it has no
;;;;     parent effect -- the caller is the source.
;;;;
;;;; That sentence is **byte for byte the same in every admitted CNA ABI** -- the
;;;; whole of `audio.h' is identical across all three admitted versions -- so the
;;;; transport, the four settings, `Apply3D' and disposal are inherited on
;;;; evidence rather than on the accident that CLOS would inherit them anyway.
;;;;
;;;; **The owner is the game, not a sound effect.** The creation route takes a game
;;;; handle and there is no effect to be a child of, so the ownership graph for
;;;; this kind is `Game -> DynamicSoundEffectInstance' with no middle. XNA's own
;;;; `Dispose(bool)' is written for exactly that: it reads `effect' and skips
;;;; `ChildDestroyed' when the field is null.
;;;;
;;;; **What is not inherited, and why each one is not:**
;;;;
;;;;   IsLooped   overridden in XNA. The getter answers `false' unconditionally --
;;;;              after an `IsDisposed' test, which the base class's getter does
;;;;              **not** have -- and the setter throws
;;;;              `InvalidOperationException(InvalidDynamicIsLoopedCall)' for a
;;;;              true value and does nothing at all for a false one. It never
;;;;              stores anything, so the base class's `looped' field is dead here.
;;;;   Play       overridden in XNA, and the override is what the base class's
;;;;              projection already does: the base `Play()' submits the effect's
;;;;              packet on the first call and this one has no packet to submit,
;;;;              so both reach the same native `Play' and both set
;;;;              `isPacketSubmitted'. The projection inherits it, and
;;;;              `tests/native/audio.lisp' pins the behaviour rather than the
;;;;              inheritance.
;;;;
;;;; **No test here claims a sound was heard.** The streaming lane submits
;;;; generated PCM through SDL's `dummy' driver, which opens a device with no
;;;; speaker behind it. What is proved is that the bytes were accepted, that the
;;;; queue depth moved, and that the buffer-needed event reached Lisp.

XNA's one public constructor, and the only shape this accepts: both keywords or
neither is not a choice -- there is no other overload, so a partial set names no
member and is refused rather than defaulted.

The buffers are **PCM16, little-endian, interleaved**, which is the one format
XNA's constructor can build: it calls `AudioFormat.Create(sampleRate, channels, 16)'
with the bit depth written into the call site. A whole sample frame is therefore
`2 * channels' bytes, and every length, offset and count `SUBMIT-BUFFER' takes
must be a whole number of them.

`PENDING-BUFFER-COUNT' is what makes streaming observable: CNA's route documents
that the count \"only shrinks once a buffer has actually been **consumed by
playback**, not merely handed to the mixer\", so a fall in that number is evidence
about the runtime rather than about this binding.

`ADD-BUFFER-NEEDED-HANDLER' subscribes to the event CNA raises when the queue runs
low. The queue is advanced by the game loop -- CNA's own header says
`cna_framework_dispatcher_update' drives it for every live instance -- so a
program that never runs a frame never sees the event, exactly as an XNA program
that never pumps its dispatcher does not."))

**The overflow branch needs no separate test, and %CHECK-COUNT already says why.**
`checked(offset + count)' is what raises `OverflowException' in the original, and
its `catch' turns that into the *same* `ArgumentException(InvalidOffsetCountLength)'
the range test below it raises -- so the two branches are one observable outcome.
Common Lisp integers do not overflow, and every value the overflow would have
caught is outside `offset + count <= buffer.Length' anyway.

`SubmitBuffer(null)' is worth a sentence, because the two overloads do not agree
about it: the short one evaluates `buffer.Length' to build the long call and
throws `NullReferenceException' before any check runs, while the long one reaches
`ArgumentException'. Both are refusals of the same call and Common Lisp has no

;;; a rooted Lisp object, and an owned registration handle. **No Lisp object is
;;; ever handed to C**; the context is a small integer token, exactly as
;;; docs/callbacks-and-threading.md requires.
;;;
;;; What is different is the two routes, and that is what the two methods below
;;; say: `cna_dynamic_sound_effect_instance_subscribe_buffer_needed' takes the
;;; callback and context directly rather than an event identity, and the
;;; registration is released by `cna_audio_unsubscribe_ext' rather than by
;;; `cna_game_unsubscribe'.
;;;
;;; **XNA's own semantics, from the IL:**
;;;
;;;   sender      the instance. `OnBufferNeeded' invokes `handler(this, args)'.
;;;   args        `EventArgs.Empty', which carries nothing -- so the projected
;;;               handler takes the sender and nothing else, the same decision
;;;               every other event here makes.
;;;   add/remove  ordinary `Delegate.Combine'/`Remove' against the private
;;;               `BufferNeeded' field, through an `Interlocked.CompareExchange'
;;;               loop, with **no** `IsDisposed' test and no other call at all --
;;;               and `Dispose(bool)' removes the instance from `allInstances'
;;;               and never touches that field. So both are legal on a disposed
;;;               instance there, `-=' still finds a handler `+=' put there
;;;               before the disposal, and neither reaches anything native.
;;;
;;;               **Both are legal here, and this is what that costs.** A live
;;;               subscription is two things -- the logical handler list and a
;;;               CNA registration -- and only the first of them survives
;;;               disposal. Adding to a disposed instance updates the list and
;;;               acquires nothing, which is honest rather than convenient: no
;;;               event can be raised on a destroyed instance, so there is
;;;               nothing to register for and faking a registration against a
;;;               dead handle would be inventing one. %EVENT-SOURCE-DISPOSED-P in
;;;               src/runtime/event-machinery.lisp is the seam, and it is shared
;;;               because the audit that found this found the same twenty-one
;;;               accessors behaving the same way across all three assemblies.
;;;   raising     a static `RaiseBufferNeededOnInstance(handle)' looks the
;;;               instance up in a table keyed by voice handle and calls
;;;               `OnBufferNeeded' on it. `Dispose(bool)' removes it from that
;;;               table **before** the base disposal deallocates the voice, so no
;;;               handler can be reached after disposal. That ordering is

  "DynamicSoundEffectInstance.BufferNeeded's `+=': call HANDLER when the queue runs low.

    (add-buffer-needed-handler instance
                               (lambda (instance)
                                 (submit-buffer instance (next-block))))

HANDLER takes the sender and nothing else, because XNA passes `EventArgs.Empty'
and a second always-empty argument would be one every handler had to write and
ignore.

It is called on the thread that advances the buffer queue, which is the game
thread while the loop runs. A condition it signals cannot be reported to CNA --
the callback answers `void' -- so it is contained there and re-signalled by the
first native call that returns to your program afterwards, which for a handler
reached during the loop is the RUN, RUN-ONE-FRAME or TICK that was running. The
condition object itself arrives, not a description of it; if a native call fails
in the same breath, that failure is what is signalled and the handler's condition
is its CNA-ERROR-CAUSE.

Legal on a disposed instance, and purely managed there: XNA's `+=' is
`Delegate.Combine' against a field its disposal never clears, so the handler list
outlives the instance even though nothing can raise the event any more.")
