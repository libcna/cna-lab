;;;; callback-registry.lisp --- resolving a C context back to a CLOS object,
;;;; and keeping a Lisp condition from unwinding across a C frame.
;;;;
;;;; CNA carries one `void*' context per callback table. CNA-Lisp never puts a
;;;; Lisp object there: a Lisp object moves, and its address means nothing after
;;;; the next garbage collection. What goes into the context is a small integer
;;;; token; this registry maps the token to the object and roots it for exactly
;;;; as long as CNA may still call back.
;;;;
;;;;   C context pointer -> integer token -> strongly rooted entry -> CLOS game
;;;;
;;;; No Lisp condition may unwind across a C callback boundary. A callback that
;;;; answers a result code runs inside WITH-CONTAINED-CALLBACK, which catches
;;;; every serious condition, preserves the condition object, writes CNA's
;;;; diagnostic structure and returns CNA_RESULT_CALLBACK; one that answers
;;;; `void' runs inside WITH-EVENT-DISPATCH instead, which has no code to answer
;;;; with. src/internal/callback-conditions.lisp is where both preserved
;;;; conditions live and where the rule for delivering each of them is written.
