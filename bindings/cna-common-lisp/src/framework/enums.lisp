;;;; enums.lisp --- how CNA-Lisp represents XNA enumerations.
;;;;
;;;; One representation, used everywhere: **an enum member is a keyword**, and
;;;; each enum gets a Common Lisp type of that name plus three functions. Keywords
;;;; read naturally, cannot be confused with an unrelated enum's member of the
;;;; same numeric value, and let CHECK-TYPE do the checking. The exact numeric
;;;; values the ABI and the contract define are preserved -- privately, in the
;;;; tables below and in the generated ones -- and are reachable through the
;;;; conversion functions for the cases where the number is itself the contract.
;;;;
;;;; A flags enum is a *list* of keywords. The empty list is the named zero
;;;; member where the enum has one.
;;;;
;;;; DEFINE-XNA-ENUM is the single place this shape is defined, so no enum can
;;;; drift into representing itself differently. It is private: it lives in the
;;;; framework package but is not exported, and the graphics package reaches it
;;;; with a double colon.
