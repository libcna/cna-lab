;;;; conditions.lisp --- the CNA-Lisp condition hierarchy.
;;;;
;;;; A consumer of CNA-Lisp sees Lisp conditions, never a result code and never
;;;; a pair of a result and a message. Every native failure is translated at the
;;;; boundary into the condition class that names what went wrong, carrying the
;;;; operation that failed, CNA's own diagnostic text and, where it is safe to
;;;; read, the object and state involved.
;;;;
;;;; The CNA result code itself is deliberately *not* a public reader: it is an
;;;; ABI detail. It is recorded in a private slot so that diagnostics and tests
;;;; can still see exactly what the ABI said.

`CAUSE' is where `System.Exception''s `innerException' constructor argument goes.
Two of the selected XNA types are exception classes, and each of them declares
the CLR's three-constructor set -- `new()', `new(String)' and
`new(String, Exception)'. The first two are `MAKE-CONDITION' with and without
`:FORMAT-CONTROL'; the third needs somewhere to put a second argument, and
without this slot it had nowhere, which would make `new(String, Exception)' a
constructor this projection cannot express rather than one it collapses.
`System.Exception' itself is not projected as a type -- it is the base-class
library's, and a Common Lisp condition is what it projects onto, the same rule
`System.IO.Stream' is read by -- so the slot holds a condition.")
