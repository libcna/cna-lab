**It removes only `IGraphicsDeviceService`.** `IGraphicsDeviceManager' is added by
the constructor and never removed by anything -- the token appears in `Dispose'
nowhere -- so a disposed manager is still registered under that key. That
asymmetry is XNA's and is reproduced.

**And it removes it only if the entry is still this manager.** The `bne.un.s'
skips the removal when the service under that key is something else, so a program
that removed the canonical service and put its own provider there keeps its
provider across the manager's disposal. A disposal that removed the key
unconditionally would silently delete a user's service.

CNA's own destroy unregisters *both* native slots regardless, so after a disposal
the managed container and CNA's two slots deliberately disagree about
`IGraphicsDeviceManager'. That is the managed side being right: the container is
the public authority and CNA's slots are a cross-check, and the cross-check is

;;; and `FindBestDevice' -> `FindBestPlatformDevice' -> `AddDevices' ->
;;; `RankDevices(foundDevices)' -> `foundDevices[0]'.
;;;
;;; **All three are partial here, for two independent measured reasons**, and
;;; both are worth stating because either alone would be enough.
;;;
;;; **1. No admitted CNA ABI has a seam to insert them into device creation.**
;;; The three are `virtual' in CNA's own C++ (`GraphicsDeviceManager.hpp' declares
;;; them so) and `grep' over `GraphicsDeviceManager.cpp' finds **no call site for
;;; any of them** outside their own definitions: CNA's `CreateDevice' and
;;; `ApplyChanges' go through `INTERNAL_CreateGraphicsDeviceInformation', which
;;; calls none of the three. Nor is any of them exposed as a C route in 0.21.0,
;;; 0.22.0 or 0.23.0. So a subclass may override these and call them, and the
;;; override will not change which device is created. In XNA it would.
;;;
;;; **2. XNA's own bodies reach two members this binding reports missing.**
;;; `AddDevices' reads `game.Window.Handle' and writes
;;; `PresentationParameters.DeviceWindowHandle', and both are absent here for
;;; reasons of their own -- CNA answers the window handle with
;;; `CNA_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED' by design, "a native window handle is not something
;;; the stable C boundary hands out". The candidate enumeration below is therefore
;;; XNA's shape without XNA's window filtering, which is a different function of
;;; the adapters and is described as one.
;;;
;;; They are implemented rather than left absent because the *members* are
;;; genuinely useful and genuinely XNA-shaped -- `CanResetDevice' reproduces its
;;; body exactly, and ranking a candidate list is a real operation a program can
;;; do. What is not claimed is that overriding them changes anything the framework
;;; does. `docs/limitations.md' carries the classification.

XNA's whole body, which is three instructions and one comparison:

-- true when the existing device's profile equals the candidate's, false
otherwise. Nothing else is consulted. Notably it does **not** consider the back
buffer, the format or the adapter, so a candidate that differs in every one of
those is still resettable as long as the profile matches.

Protected and virtual in XNA, so a subclass may override it, and a CLOS method is
that override. **Partial**: no admitted CNA ABI calls this during device change,
so an override does not affect whether a device is reset. See this file's comment
on the device-selection surface.

**Answers the ranked sequence, and callers must use the answer.** XNA's signature
returns void and sorts the caller's `List<T>' in place -- `RankDevicesPlatform' is
`foundDevices.Sort(new GraphicsDeviceInformationComparer(this))' -- and
`FindBestPlatformDevice' then takes `foundDevices[0]' from the list it passed in.
A Common Lisp list cannot be reordered in place in a way a caller's variable would
see, and `SORT' is permitted to destroy its argument, so this projection is
explicit about both halves: the argument may be destroyed, and the ranked sequence
is the return value. A caller that ignores the answer has ignored the ranking,
which is exactly the failure a silent temporary copy would have hidden.

A list stays a list and a vector stays a vector; `List<GraphicsDeviceInformation>'
is not projected as a BCL type, for the reason no other generic collection here is.

  2. the candidate whose `IsFullScreen' matches the manager's preference first;
  3. the higher-ranked back-buffer format first, by the comparer's own
     `RankFormat';

  5. the candidate whose aspect ratio is closest to the preferred one, where the
     comparer treats differences within `0.2' as a tie and falls back to the
     preferred back-buffer size when none was set.

The tie-breaks after those read `Adapter.CurrentDisplayMode' and the window
handle, and the window half has no counterpart here; ranking stops where its
inputs do rather than inventing an order."

    (find-best-device manager nil)   ; => a GRAPHICS-DEVICE-INFORMATION

XNA's `FindBestPlatformDevice' in shape:

  1. build a candidate for every adapter that supports the manager's profile;
  2. if none and `PreferMultiSampling' is set, **clear it and try again** -- a
     side effect on the manager, and one the IL really has: `set_PreferMultiSampling(false)';
  3. if still none, refuse;
  4. `RANK-DEVICES' the candidates -- the virtual one, so a subclass's override
     runs here;
  5. answer the first.

ANY-SUITABLE-DEVICE is XNA's `anySuitableDevice', which there means \"do not
restrict to adapters the game's window is on\". **This binding cannot make that
restriction either way**: it needs `GameWindow.Handle', which is a missing member
because CNA answers the window handle with `CNA_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED' by design.
So the argument is accepted, is part of the member's shape, and does not change
the answer -- which is why the member is reported partial rather than complete,
alongside the seam reason this file's comment gives.
