;;;; game-components.lisp --- GameComponent, DrawableGameComponent and the
;;;; collection the game drives them from.
;;;;
;;;; **This is the one place in the binding where the consumer provides behaviour
;;;; rather than consuming it.** Everywhere else CNA-Lisp calls CNA; a component
;;;; is an object CNA calls, once per frame, from inside the game loop. CNA's own
;;;; header explains why it is shaped as a callback set: its component types are
;;;; C++ interfaces, C cannot implement an interface, so the ABI takes handlers
;;;; and supplies the object that implements the interfaces and forwards to them.
;;;;
;;;; **The component engine is CNA's, and it is really wired up.** A component is
;;;; not a list this binding walks: `cna_game_components_add' puts it in the
;;;; collection the game drives, and CNA calls `initialize', `update', `draw',
;;;; `load-content' and `unload-content' in its own order, honouring
;;;; `UpdateOrder', `DrawOrder', `Enabled' and `Visible'. A component added after
;;;; the game has initialized is initialized when it is added, which is XNA's
;;;; behaviour and CNA's documented one.
;;;;
;;;; **The lifecycle generic functions are the same ones a Game overrides.**
;;;; XNA's `GameComponent.Update' and `Game.Update' have the same name for the
;;;; same reason, and here they are the same generic function with a method on a
;;;; different class. A consumer writes
;;;;
;;;;     (defclass spinner (xna:drawable-game-component) ())
;;;;     (defmethod xna:update ((c spinner) game-time) ...)
;;;;     (defmethod xna:draw   ((c spinner) game-time) ...)
;;;;
;;;; and nothing else. There is no register-this-method step, because CLOS is the
;;;; registration.
;;;;
;;;; **`IGameComponent', `IUpdateable' and `IDrawable' are generic functions**,
;;;; the same way the three `IEffect*' contracts are: the interface is what the
;;;; object answers, and CLOS dispatches it.
;;;;
;;;; `Game.Services' is **not** here, and the reason is CNA's container rather
;;;; than the interfaces that key it. Read from the pinned metadata:
;;;; `IGraphicsDeviceService' is `GraphicsDevice', `DeviceCreated',
;;;; `DeviceDisposing', `DeviceReset' and `DeviceResetting', and all five are
;;;; already complete on `GraphicsDeviceManager', the type that implements it.
;;;; (`GraphicsDevice' has events of its own called `DeviceReset' and
;;;; `DeviceResetting' too; they are a different set on a different type, and
;;;; confusing the two is what this comment used to do.)
;;;;
;;;; What is missing is a container. CNA has `cna_game_services_contains_ext' and
;;;; `remove_ext' over a closed enum of runtime-registered identities, and no
;;;; route that registers a service or hands one back -- so `GetService', the
;;;; member the type exists for, cannot be answered for the two services XNA
;;;; itself registers. A Lisp dictionary would answer it for services the program
;;;; added and quietly invent the rest. `docs/limitations.md' records it.

`cna_game_component_destroy' releases the handle. So the canonical one goes
first, while a handler subscribed to `Disposed' is still there to hear it.

The subscriptions come next and not last, because **a registration keeps the
component alive** -- CNA's header says so in as many words -- and a destroy with
one outstanding is refused. That is the opposite of the ordering a
GraphicsResource wants, where the Disposing event is raised *inside* the
