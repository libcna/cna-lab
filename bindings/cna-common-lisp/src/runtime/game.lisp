;;;; game.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.
;;;;
;;;; GAME is a public CLOS class designed to be subclassed, and the game loop is
;;;; a set of generic functions a subclass specialises. There is no public
;;;; callback table: a consumer writes methods, and the private runtime is what
;;;; knows that CNA calls C function pointers.
;;;;
;;;; The path from a native callback back to a method is:
;;;;
;;;;   CNA's void* context -> integer token -> callback registry -> this GAME
;;;;
;;;; and every one of those callbacks runs inside WITH-CONTAINED-CALLBACK, so a
;;;; condition signalled by a method never unwinds through a C frame. It is
;;;; preserved, reported to CNA as a callback failure, and re-signalled on the
;;;; Lisp side once RUN or TICK has returned.
