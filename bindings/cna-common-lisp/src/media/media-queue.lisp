;;;; media-queue.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.MediaQueue.
;;;;
;;;; **The queue is stateless, and that is the pinned IL's answer rather than a
;;;; simplification.** `MediaQueue' declares no fields at all; its constructor is
;;;; `ldarg.0; call object..ctor; ret' and every one of its four public members
;;;; goes to the native layer on every read. So the CLOS facade holds nothing
;;;; either.
;;;;
;;;; **There is exactly one of it, and its identity is guaranteed.**
;;;; `MediaPlayer''s static constructor creates one `MediaQueue' and stores it in
;;;; a static field; `get_Queue' answers that field. So `MediaPlayer.Queue' is
;;;; reference-identical for the life of the process, and `MEDIA-PLAYER-QUEUE'
;;;; reproduces that with one process-global object.
;;;;
;;;; CNA agrees about the singleton and disagrees about the handle: it hands out a
;;;; **borrowed view** of "the process-wide media queue", and releasing that view
;;;; releases only the view. A facade that cached the view handle would be holding
;;;; a borrowed handle across game lifetimes, so instead every operation resolves
;;;; the view, uses it, and releases it. That is what a stateless facade over a
;;;; process-global thing costs, and it is cheap.
