;;;; media-player.lisp --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.MediaPlayer.
;;;;
;;;; **A static class, and this binding has not had one with events before.**
;;;; `MediaPlayer' is `abstract sealed` in the pinned IL -- C#'s `static class` --
;;;; so it has no instances and every one of its twenty members is static. Its
;;;; state is five static fields: `shuffle', `repeat', the one `queue', and the
;;;; two event delegates.
;;;;
;;;; Static members project as `MEDIA-PLAYER-<member>', the naming rule
;;;; `Keyboard', `Mouse' and `GamePad' already follow. There is no class to
;;;; export and no object to pass.
;;;;
;;;; --- the two events are static, and their sender is null -------------------
;;;;
;;;; `OnActiveSongChanged' and `OnMediaStateChanged' both invoke
;;;; `handler(null, args)': the event is static, so there is no instance to be the
;;;; sender. Every other event in this binding passes its sender and nothing else;
;;;; **these pass nothing at all**, because a handler that took one always-null
;;;; argument would be one every handler had to write and ignore -- the same
;;;; reasoning that dropped the always-empty `EventArgs' everywhere else, applied
;;;; to the other argument.
;;;;
;;;; CNA agrees that the player is process-global, and says so in the strongest
;;;; way available to it: `cna_media_player_subscribe_active_song_changed_ext' and
;;;; its media-state sibling take a callback, a context and an out-registration
;;;; and **no game handle**. They are the only subscribe routes in this ABI that
;;;; do. So the subscription outlives any particular game, exactly as the static
;;;; delegate field does.
;;;;
;;;; The handler lists therefore need a home that is not an object slot, and they
;;;; get one: a private singleton the shared event machinery specialises on. That
;;;; keeps one mechanism for every CLR event in this binding -- the same
;;;; %SUBSCRIBE-EVENT, the same rooted-token discipline, the same
;;;; failed-unsubscribe rule -- rather than a second registry for the static case.
;;;;
;;;; --- what the IL guards, and CNA does not ---------------------------------
;;;;
;;;; Three of the transport members are **conditional in XNA and unconditional in
;;;; CNA**, and the guard is observable:
;;;;
;;;;   Pause     runs only when State == Playing; otherwise it does nothing
;;;;   Resume    runs only when State != Playing; otherwise it does nothing
;;;;   Stop      runs only when State != Stopped; otherwise it does nothing
;;;;
;;;; So pausing a stopped player is a no-op in the original rather than an error
;;;; or a state change, and the guards are reproduced here rather than left to
;;;; CNA -- which accepts all three unconditionally.

    (media-player-play song)                  Play(Song)
    (media-player-play collection)            Play(SongCollection)
    (media-player-play collection 2)          Play(SongCollection, Int32)

Three overloads, told apart by **CLOS dispatch on the first argument's type and
by arity** -- not by keywords, because two of the three differ in a positional
parameter's type rather than in an optional. `(media-player-play song 2)' names
no overload and is refused: XNA has no `Play(Song, Int32)', and a method that
accepted and ignored the index would give it one.

The validation is the pinned IL's, in its order:

    song == null                 -> ArgumentNullException(\"song\")
    songCollection == null       -> ArgumentNullException(\"songCollection\")
    songCollection.Count == 0    -> ArgumentException(EmptySongCollections...)
    index outside [0, Count)     -> ArgumentOutOfRangeException(\"index\")

A song whose handle is not live makes XNA's `MediaQueue.Play' answer `E_FAIL' and
wrap it in `InvalidOperationException(SongPlaybackFailed)'; here a disposed song
is refused by the ordinary disposal check first, which is the same refusal
arriving one step earlier.

Every overload **clears the queue first**: CNA's `play_song' route says so, and
XNA's queue does the same.

`cna_song_create' **succeeds** -- the canonical constructor only checks that the

arguments would be worse than one that accepts none.

It is called on the thread that advances the frame. A condition it signals cannot
be reported to CNA -- the callback answers `void' -- so it is contained there and
re-signalled by the first native call that returns to your program afterwards,
