;;;; content-loaders.lisp --- the asset types LOAD-ASSET has a route for.
;;;;
;;;; Separate from content-manager.lisp because these produce *graphics* objects
;;;; and so must load after the graphics layer, while the manager itself must load
;;;; before nothing in particular. Each entry is one `cna_content_manager_load_*'
;;;; route, and the table is what makes `Load<T>' a single member rather than
;;;; three differently-named functions.
;;;;
;;;; **One asset load is one transaction, and it is this file's.** Every loader
;;;; here opens exactly one rollback ledger and every native handle the load
;;;; acquires is recorded in it, once, in CNA's required destruction order. The
;;;; adoption helpers in the graphics layer take that ledger's recorder as an
;;;; argument and record only the *Lisp* state they create -- the CLOS object and
;;;; its registration as a child. The rule, which each helper repeats:
;;;;
;;;;     whoever receives a handle from CNA records its destruction.
;;;;
;;;; The shape this replaced had the loader record a handle and then call a helper
;;;; that opened its own ledger and recorded the same handle again. A failure
;;;; inside the helper destroyed the handle twice -- and for a SpriteFont it was
;;;; worse: the atlas was adopted by a ledger that had already committed, so a
;;;; later failure destroyed the atlas handle while the atlas object stayed
;;;; registered as a live child of the game. The game then refused to shut down, a
;;;; whole callback away from the load that broke it.

;;; would answer two objects for one name and hand a program two things to dispose
;;; where XNA gives it one.

;;; --- Model --------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; `cna_content_manager_load_model' "maps the canonical `Load<Model>'
;;; specialization -- the route an XNA game's `ContentManager.Load<Model>' takes".
;;; It reads a compiled `.xnb' model and CNA's own self-contained `.cnj' model
;;; document; the fixture this suite uses is the second, for the reason
;;; `docs/limitations.md' gives for the font and the effect.
;;;
;;; **The model owns what it publishes, and the loader must not record any of
;;; it.** The route's header is explicit: "A loaded part's effect and buffers are
;;; objects the model already owned, and the handles this route creates for them
;;; are released when the model is destroyed -- do not release them by hand". So
;;; there is exactly one handle for this loader to be responsible for, the
;;; model's, and %ADOPT-MODEL is what receives it and therefore what records its
;;; destruction. One asset load, one ledger, as every other loader here.
;;;
;;; **The cache is this binding's, in front of CNA's.** CNA's own route does cache
;;; -- "the asset is cached by name exactly as every other load is, so a second
;;; call re-publishes handles over the same underlying model rather than re-reading
;;; the file" -- but re-publishing answers a *new* model handle over the same
;;; native model, and XNA's `Load<T>' answers the same object. Two model handles
;;; for one name would be two objects for one name and two graphs to keep in step.
;;; So `%COMMIT-LOADED-ASSET' caches, and a second `Load<Model>' never reaches CNA.

defers the fault to `cna_game_destroy'. It is fixed in 0.22.0, where the same

binding.

There is no sound fallback. Leaking the handle is not one: CNA refuses to destroy
a game that still owns a model, so the program would get a game that cannot shut
down instead of a crash, which is a worse failure and further from its cause. So
the loader refuses on 0.21.0, before anything is created, and names the defect.
