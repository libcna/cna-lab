;;;;
;;;; The type that makes a `SpriteFont' obtainable. Everything else in this
;;;; binding can be built from arguments; a font cannot, because a font is glyph
;;;; metrics and an atlas that have to come from somewhere. Until this file
;;;; existed the only producer was a test-only one, and the template could not
;;;; draw text at all.
;;;;
;;;; **`Load<T>' is where Common Lisp gets to do what C could not.** CNA's ABI
;;;; spells the generic method as one route per asset type -- `..._load_texture2d',
;;;; `..._load_sprite_font', `..._load_texture_cube' -- because a C caller cannot
;;;; name a type. Common Lisp can, so `Load<SpriteFont>("Arial")' projects as
;;;; `(load-asset content 'sprite-font "Arial")' and stays one member rather than
;;;; becoming three differently-named functions. LOADABLE-ASSET-TYPES answers
;;;; which types this binding actually has a route for; it is a declared
;;;; extension, because XNA's `Load<T>' is generic over anything with a reader
;;;; and needs no such list.
;;;;
;;;; **A game's manager is a facade, an own one is not.** CNA lends the game's
;;;; manager as a borrowed handle that "answers the same handle every time, cannot
;;;; be destroyed, and is released with its game", so MICROSOFT.XNA.FRAMEWORK:
;;;; CONTENT is a parent-owned facade over the game, resolving that handle per
;;;; call exactly as GRAPHICS-DEVICE does. A manager built here instead is an
;;;; ordinary owned child of the game and is disposed like one.
;;;;
;;;; **What is projected, and what this paragraph used to say.** Both of XNA's
;;;; constructors take an `IServiceProvider', and until the Services closure this
;;;; binding had none to give them -- so construction here was a declared
;;;; extension over a graphics device, and `Game.Content''s setter was not
;;;; projected at all. **Both of those statements are now false.**
;;;; `GAME-SERVICE-CONTAINER' is a real `IServiceProvider', so
;;;; `ContentManager(IServiceProvider)' and `ContentManager(IServiceProvider,
;;;; String)' are both canonical constructors here; the graphics-device shape is
;;;; kept beside them as the extension it always was, because a working
;;;; constructor is not removed when a better-named one arrives. And
;;;; `(setf CONTENT)' is a projected member: XNA's setter is a null check and a
;;;; `stfld', which is what it is here, and it makes no native call -- see
;;;; `src/content/game-content.lisp' for why `cna_game_set_content_manager_ext'
;;;; is not the route it would use even if it made one.

The IL, which settles four questions a reader would otherwise have to guess at:

    loadedAssets     = new Dictionary<string,object>(OrdinalIgnoreCase)
    disposableAssets = new List<IDisposable>()
    Object..ctor()
    if (serviceProvider == null) throw ArgumentNullException(\"serviceProvider\")
    if (rootDirectory  == null) throw ArgumentNullException(\"rootDirectory\")
    RootDirectory = rootDirectory
    this.serviceProvider = serviceProvider

**The constructor does not resolve anything.** It stores the provider and asks it
for nothing; `ContentManager' in the pinned assembly calls `GetService' nowhere at
all. The graphics device is resolved *per load*, in the Graphics assembly's
`GraphicsContentHelper.GraphicsDeviceFromContentReader':

    contentManager.ServiceProvider.GetService(typeof(IGraphicsDeviceService))
      -> castclass IGraphicsDeviceService   // a wrong type is InvalidCastException
      -> null?          ContentLoadException
      -> .GraphicsDevice
      -> null?          ContentLoadException

So a provider whose service changes after construction is honoured on the next
load, and a provider with no graphics device service is an error at load time
rather than at construction. That is XNA's behaviour and not a convenience.

**CNA cannot be lazy in the same way**, and this is where the two runtimes have to
be reconciled rather than one being pretended into the other.
`cna_content_manager_create' takes a graphics device and makes the native manager
out of it, so a native manager cannot exist before one is resolved. This
constructor therefore resolves the service **once, here**, to build the native
manager -- and keeps the provider so that `SERVICE-PROVIDER' answers the object it
was given and a later load sees whatever the provider then holds. The difference
is confined to *when* a missing service is reported: here rather than at the first
load. It is reported with the same information either way, and the alternative --
a manager with no native object behind it, failing at its first load far from the
MAKE-INSTANCE that produced it - is the shape this file already refuses for the
extension constructor."

TYPE is the Lisp type symbol XNA spells as the generic argument, which is the one
place this projection is *closer* to XNA than the C ABI can be: `Load<T>' stays a
single member instead of becoming one function per asset type.

The asset name is logical, resolved against ROOT-DIRECTORY, and its extension is
optional. LOADABLE-ASSET-TYPES answers which types are loadable.

**Loading the same name twice answers the same object**, which is XNA's cache and
is what the implementation below does: the cleaned name is looked up first, a hit
of the right type is answered as it stands, and only a miss reads anything. A hit
of the *wrong* type is a failure rather than a second load, because XNA's cache is
keyed by the cleaned name alone. CNA's own per-asset routes do not cache -- their
headers say so -- so the cache is this binding's, over them.

The loaded object is owned by the manager, and UNLOAD disposes it. A program may
still dispose one itself; DISPOSE is idempotent, so the manager's later pass over
it costs nothing."))

holding an asset the other has let go.

The cache and the disposal list are cleared however this ends. If an asset's
