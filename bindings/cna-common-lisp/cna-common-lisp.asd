   ;; The cube target derives from TextureCube and RenderTargetBinding names
   ;; both kinds, so this loads after both target families exist.
   (:file "graphics/render-target-cube")
   ;; DisplayMode and PresentationParameters are value snapshots the device
   ;; answers; they load after the enumerations they carry -- DepthFormat and
   ;; RenderTargetUsage are declared with the render targets -- and they carry

   (:file "input/keyboard-state")

   (:file "input/mouse")
   (:file "input/game-pad")
   (:file "input/touch")
   ;; --- the service container and the two device-service interfaces --------
   ;; Before GAME, because `Game.Services' is a slot of that class and XNA's own
   ;; constructor fills the field before its body runs. The container reaches
   ;; nothing but the condition types, so this is the earliest it can go.
   (:file "runtime/game-services")
   (:file "runtime/device-service-protocols")
   ;; GraphicsDeviceInformation needs PresentationParameters and GraphicsAdapter,
   ;; both of which are above, and is needed by the manager below.

   ;; --- Game and the graphics device manager ------------------------------
   (:file "runtime/game")
   (:file "runtime/game-events")
   ;; The native cross-check for CNA's two canonical service slots. After GAME,
   ;; because it reads `Game.Services' and the game's handle.
   (:file "runtime/game-service-sync")
   (:file "runtime/graphics-device-manager")
   ;; GameWindow is a facade over the game and uses the event machinery, so it
   ;; loads after GAME and before anything that reaches a window.
   (:file "runtime/game-window")
   (:file "runtime/manager-events")
   ;; PreparingDeviceSettings: the event args, the fifth virtual raiser and the
   ;; mutable callback. After manager-events, whose raiser table and release it
   ;; shares, and after graphics-device-information, whose object it carries.
   (:file "runtime/preparing-device-settings")
   ;; The graphics device's own four events. After manager-events, because three
   ;; of the four pairs are shared with types declared there and in
   ;; graphics-resource, and a method needs its generic function to exist.
   (:file "graphics/graphics-device-events")
   ;; The component engine: classes CNA calls back into, and the collection the
   ;; game drives them from. After Game, whose class it extends.
   (:file "runtime/game-components")
   ;; TitleContainer resolves the title location through a game, so it loads
   ;; after GAME exists.
   (:file "runtime/title-container")
   ;; --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Audio --------------------------------------
   ;; The two exceptions first: they are conditions, and a condition has to exist
   ;; before the code that signals it. Then the enumerations, then the two
   ;; spatial value holders, which name Vector3 and nothing else.
   (:file "audio/conditions")
   (:file "audio/enums")

   ;; The RIFF/WAVE shape FromStream accepts. Before sound-effect, which calls it
   ;; before CNA's decoder -- which accepts more than XNA does.
   (:file "audio/wave")
   ;; SoundEffect names SOUND-EFFECT-INSTANCE in CREATE-INSTANCE and the instance
   ;; names SOUND-EFFECT in its owner slot, so the two are mutually recursive at
   ;; run time and orderable at load time: the effect first, because the instance
   ;; specialises on its class.
   (:file "audio/sound-effect")
   (:file "audio/sound-effect-instance")
   ;; The streaming subclass last of the three, because it specialises the base
   ;; class's construction and destruction hooks and reuses SoundEffect's own
   ;; validators and sample arithmetic. It names no SOUND-EFFECT: a
   ;; DynamicSoundEffectInstance has none, and is a child of the game directly.
   (:file "audio/dynamic-sound-effect-instance")
   ;; The capture half, last of the namespace. It is not a NATIVE-OBJECT and owns
   ;; no handle -- the runtime owns the devices -- but it reuses SoundEffect's
   ;; active-game resolution, its buffer/offset/count validators and its TimeSpan
   ;; arithmetic, so it loads after the three that define them.
   (:file "audio/microphone")
   ;; --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media --------------------------------------
   ;; The playback closure. After Audio because it resolves the active game the
   ;; same way and because nothing here is a SoundEffect; before Content, which
   ;; names neither. The enumeration and the buffer pair first -- both are pure
   ;; values -- then Song and SongCollection, which are native objects, then the
   ;; queue facade over them, then the static player that drives all three.

   ;; --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content ------------------------------------
   ;; The manager first, then the loaders that produce graphics objects, then
   ;; Game.Content, which needs both GAME and CONTENT-MANAGER to exist.
   (:file "content/content-manager")
   (:file "content/content-loaders")
   (:file "content/game-content")
   ;; Game's private device-event wiring: `HookDeviceEvents' and the four
   ;; handlers it installs. Last of the three, because the DeviceDisposing
   ;; handler calls `ContentManager.Unload' on `Game.Content' and so needs both
   ;; the manager and the property; and after runtime/manager-events, whose
   ;; framework-listener list it subscribes into. Nothing public is declared
   ;; here -- the whole file is one XNA lifecycle invariant.
   (:file "runtime/game-device-events")
   ;; --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage -------------------------------------
   ;; The one namespace that needs no game at all: no storage route takes one.
   ;; The enumerations and the condition first, then the stream -- which the
   ;; container's four file members answer -- then the container, then the device
   ;; that owns it. The ownership graph here is three deep, which is new:
   ;; StorageDevice -> StorageContainer -> StorageStream.
   (:file "storage/enums")
   (:file "storage/conditions")
   ;; Where the saves go: two CNA extensions with no XNA member behind them,
   ;; because off the Xbox nothing derives a title's directory for it.

   (:file "storage/storage-stream")
   (:file "storage/storage-container")
   (:file "storage/storage-device")
   ;; --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media, the library half ---------------------
   ;; **After Storage, and that is the only reason it is not beside its own
   ;; namespace.** It reuses %MEDIA-GAME, SONG-COLLECTION and the COUNT-OF/ITEM
   ;; generic functions the playback half declares, so it must follow those; and
   ;; `MediaLibrary.SavePicture(String, Stream)' specialises on
   ;; `STORAGE-STREAM', which CNA calls "the only byte source this ABI owns", so
   ;; it must follow that class too. A method cannot be defined on a class that
   ;; does not exist yet.
