;;;; suite.lisp --- the CNA-Lisp test suite's shape.
;;;;
;;;; Four layers, and the difference between them matters:
;;;;
;;;;   :unit       pure Lisp; no native library, no CNA
;;;;   :structure  the public surface and the generated files, in this image
;;;;   :behavior   the behaviour corpus, with each observation's origin recorded
;;;;   :native     a real CNA C ABI library, exercised for real
;;;;
;;;; The native layer never "passes" without a library. When CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY
;;;; is unset it is reported as NOT RUN and the runner says so; when it is set
;;;; and the library is unusable the tests fail, they do not skip.
