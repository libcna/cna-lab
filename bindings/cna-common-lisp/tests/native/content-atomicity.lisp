;;;; content-atomicity.lisp --- one asset load is one transaction, proved.
;;;;
;;;; `tests/native/content.lisp' proves that a load that fails *before any handle
;;;; exists* -- a missing asset -- leaves the game owning nothing. That is the easy
;;;; half. This file is the hard half: a load whose native handles were acquired
;;;; and whose *later* steps fail.
;;;;
;;;; The shape being defended against is nested ledgers. Before this, a loader
;;;; recorded a handle's destruction in its own rollback and then called an
;;;; adoption helper that opened a second rollback and recorded the same handle
;;;; again. Two consequences, and the second is the dangerous one:
;;;;
;;;;   * the handle was destroyed twice, the inner ledger first and the outer one
;;;;     afterwards, on a handle CNA had already taken back;
;;;;   * for a SpriteFont, the atlas was adopted by an inner ledger that then
;;;;     *committed*. A failure in the font's own metadata therefore destroyed the
;;;;     atlas handle from the outer ledger while the atlas object stayed
;;;;     registered as a live child of the game -- a CLOS object that looked alive
;;;;     over a handle that was gone. The symptom was not here: it was the game
;;;;     refusing to shut down, a whole callback later.
;;;;
;;;; **How a destroy is counted.** The rollback thunks call the generated FFI
;;;; routes by name, and those are ordinary functions with no compiler macro and
;;;; no inline declaration, so binding their FDEFINITION around a load intercepts
;;;; every call the library makes. That is what turns "destroyed exactly once"
;;;; from an inference into a measurement.
;;;;
;;;; **How a step is made to fail.** `%read-texture-storage', `%sprite-font-info'
;;;; and `%read-font-glyph-table' are generic functions, and each says in its own
;;;; documentation that being one is what lets a test make that step fail. The
;;;; `:around' methods here are unspecialised and do nothing at all unless
;;;; *EXPLODING-STEP* names them, so they are inert for every other test in the
;;;; suite.
