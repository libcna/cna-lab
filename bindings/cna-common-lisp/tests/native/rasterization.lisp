;;;; rasterization.lisp --- whether drawing reaches pixels, and how we know.
;;;;
;;;; Every other native test in this suite proves *submission*: the lifecycle
;;;; ran, the handles were valid, CNA accepted the commands. None of them can
;;;; say anything about pixels, and the qualification has always said so.
;;;;
;;;; GraphicsDevice.GetBackBufferData is the member that can, and CNA is honest
;;;; about which renderers have it: the route answers CNA_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED
;;;; "when the active renderer has no honest back-buffer readback" rather than a
;;;; buffer of zeroes. So these tests do not skip. They branch on the renderer
;;;; that is actually present and assert the truth for it:
;;;;
;;;;   HEADLESS  -- the readback must be refused, and refused by name;
;;;;   SOFTWARE  -- the readback must answer the exact pixels that were cleared.
;;;;
;;;; Both are real assertions. Which one ran is printed by the runner, because a
;;;; suite that passed without ever reaching the second branch has proved
;;;; nothing about rasterisation and must not be read as though it had.

;;; These two close that gap.
;;;
;;; Everything about the draw is chosen so that a disagreement can only be the
;;; rasteriser's:
;;;
;;;   * the texture is generated, not drawn -- every texel is stated in
;;;     tools/qualification/make-pixel-fixtures.py and is fully opaque;
;;;   * the destination rectangle is the texture's own size, so one texel is one
;;;     pixel and no filter can interpolate;
;;;   * PointClamp, so even that is not left to a default;
;;;   * BlendState.Opaque, so the source colour is what lands;
;;;   * Color.White as the tint, so nothing is multiplied;
;;;   * no rotation, no scale, no origin, no layer depth;
;;;   * integer placement, well away from any viewport edge;
;;;   * the sampled pixels are whole texels in from nothing -- the test reads the
;;;     corners of the destination rectangle and the pixels immediately outside
;;;     it, which is where an off-by-one would show.

;;; --- does DrawString reach pixels, and is it laying text out? -------------------
;;;
;;; The sprite proof above shows that one texture's texels can reach the back
;;; buffer. Text is a different claim, and closing the gap with one glyph would
;;; not close it: a projection that drew the first glyph and stopped, or drew
;;; every glyph at the same place, or used the wrong glyph's atlas rectangle,
;;; would all pass a one-glyph test.
;;;
;;; So the atlas is two glyphs in two **different colours** -- 'A' opaque red,
;;; 'B' opaque green -- and the two proofs below read pixels that only the right
;;; layout can produce:
;;;
;;;   "AB"    a pixel inside the second glyph must be **green**. That is the
;;;           advance (B starts exactly 8 pixels right of A, which is A's kerning
;;;           width plus its right bearing plus the zero spacing) *and* the
;;;           per-glyph source rectangle (B is cut from the atlas's right half)
;;;           in one assertion.
;;;
;;;   "A\nA"  a pixel on the second line must be red, twelve rows below the
;;;           first, and the four rows between the two eight-row glyphs must
;;;           still be the clear colour. That is the newline advancing by
;;;           LineSpacing rather than by the glyph height.
;;;
;;; Everything else is pinned the way the sprite proof pins it: PointClamp,
;;; BlendState.Opaque, Color.White, unit scale, no rotation, no origin, integer
;;; placement well inside the viewport, and every sampled pixel at least two
;;; pixels from any glyph edge.

;;; --- do the other stock effects reach pixels? ------------------------------------
;;;
;;; A narrower claim than the three above, and stated narrowly on purpose.
;;;
;;; What this proves: an `AlphaTestEffect' and a `SkinnedEffect' are usable *draw*
;;; effects. Each is constructed, its technique's pass is applied, a
;;; DrawUserPrimitives triangle is submitted through it and accepted, and the
;;; triangle's own vertex colour lands on exactly the pixels its geometry covers.
;;; A wrong technique graph, a pass that would not apply, or an effect the device
;;; refused to draw through would all fail here.
;;;
;;; What it does **not** prove, and what nothing in this repository proves:
;;;
;;;   * **the alpha test itself.** Measured, not assumed: CNA's `GpuDrawParams'
;;;     carries `alphaTest[4]' and `alphaTestEffect', and
;;;     `modules/renderers/software/src/SoftwareRenderer.cpp' never reads
;;;     `alphaTest' at all. So `AlphaFunction' and `ReferenceAlpha' round-trip
;;;     through the ABI and change no pixel under this renderer -- `:never' with a
;;;     reference alpha of 128 draws the same triangle `:always' does. That is an
;;;     upstream renderer limitation, recorded in `docs/limitations.md', not a
;;;     projection defect.
;;;   * **skinning.** The software renderer does implement a bone palette, but
;;;     only for a *skinned vertex layout* -- blend indices and weights, which
;;;     none of XNA's four standard vertex types has and this milestone does not
;;;     project. Replacing bone zero with a translation moves nothing drawn from
;;;     a `VertexPositionColor' array, and correctly so.
;;;   * **DualTextureEffect at all.** It needs two texture layers *and* a second
;;;     texture coordinate; CNA refuses the draw outright without the first
;;;     ("dualTexture=true but texture1 is null"), and the second has no standard
;;;     vertex type. It has state evidence only.

;;; --- do render targets hold what was drawn into them? -----------------------------
;;;
;;; The proof this closure was worth doing for, and it is three claims in one run:
;;;
;;;   1. **the bind redirected the drawing.** The back buffer is cleared to
;;;      CornflowerBlue; a target is bound and cleared to red; the back buffer is
;;;      read *before anything else happens* and must still be entirely
;;;      CornflowerBlue. A clear that had leaked to the back buffer fails here.
;;;   2. **the restore worked, and the target kept its contents.** The back buffer
;;;      is restored, the target is drawn onto it as an ordinary texture -- which
;;;      it is, because `RenderTarget2D' derives from `Texture2D' -- and the
;;;      pixels under it are red.
;;;   3. **and only under it.** The pixels immediately outside the destination
;;;      rectangle are still the clear colour.
;;;
;;; Claim 2 is the one that matters for the qualification: a render target's
;;; contents can be read on any renderer that can draw at all, so this is the
;;; first evidence here that does not depend on the back buffer being readable.
;;; It still *uses* the back-buffer readback to check itself, because that is what
;;; this renderer offers; the point is that the mechanism no longer has to be the
;;; only one.
