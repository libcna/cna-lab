;;;; audio.lisp --- the SoundEffect closure against a real CNA C ABI library.
;;;;
;;;; **Nothing here is a claim that a sound was heard.** What these tests prove
;;;; is that the values a program supplies reach CNA, that CNA accepts them, that
;;;; the state machine transitions where its header says it does, and that the
;;;; ownership graph is the one CNA documents. `docs/qualification.md` names the
;;;; evidence levels; audible correctness is not among them and no assertion below
;;;; implies it.
;;;;
;;;; **The fixtures are generated here, in Lisp, and are silence or a computed
;;;; waveform.** No sample audio of any kind is stored in this repository. Exact
;;;; signed little-endian PCM16, byte for byte, so that every duration and every
;;;; alignment refusal below is arithmetic a reader can redo.
;;;;
;;;; **A game exists for the whole of each test.** XNA's audio API takes no game,
;;;; and CNA's routes need one; the binding resolves the process's one active game
;;;; and these tests create one for it to find. The refusal when there is none is
;;;; tested too, and that one runs with no game at all.
;;;;
;;;; **Every test that needs a playback device branches on whether one opened, and
;;;; both branches assert.** This is the rasterizer lane's rule applied to audio,
;;;; and for the same reason: a lane that cannot fail for the right reason proves
;;;; nothing. `cna_audio_get_capabilities' reports `is_playback_available' as
;;;; *data* -- it answers `CNA_RESULT_SUCCESS` either way and its header says so --
;;;; so the branch is a measurement rather than a guess.
;;;;
;;;;   playback available    the full behaviour is asserted
;;;;   playback unavailable  **AUDIO_UNAVAILABLE**: creating an effect must fail
;;;;                         with exactly NO-AUDIO-HARDWARE-ERROR, and does
;;;;
;;;; Neither branch is a skip. A GitHub runner has no sound card and takes the
;;;; second branch; a developer's machine takes the first. The runner prints which
;;;; one ran, because a summary that did not say so would let the unavailable
;;;; branch be read as though the available one had passed.

(define-audio-device-test xna-quantises-a-duration-to-whole-milliseconds-and-cna-does-not
  "**Two measured divergences, pinned on both sides, and both were misread once.**

XNA's `GetSampleDuration' is `AudioFormat.DurationFromSize': integer-divide the
byte count by the block align, multiply by 1000 and divide by the sample rate in
binary32, and hand the result to `TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds'. What that last step
does is the part this test exists for. It is `TimeSpan.Interval(v, 1)' in the
pinned mscorlib:

    millis = v + (v >= 0 ? 0.5 : -0.5)
    ticks  = (long)millis * 10000

-- the half is added to the **millisecond** count and the truncation applies to
*that*, before the multiplication. So the answer is always a whole number of
milliseconds, rounded half away from zero, and 12.5 ms is **130000** ticks.

This binding used to compute `(long)(v * 10000 + 0.5)' and answer 125000, and the
comment beside it called that 'the exact 12.5 ms the buffer holds'. It is the
exact 12.5 ms, and it is not what `TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds' returns.

  1. `cna_sound_effect_get_sample_duration_ticks' answers **120000** -- 12 ms,
     truncated rather than rounded.
  2. `cna_sound_effect_get_duration_ticks', the effect's own, answers **125000**
     -- the exact tick count, not quantised at all. This one was previously
     recorded as agreeing with XNA to the tick; it agreed with the *old*
     arithmetic, which was wrong, and it does not agree with XNA.

So all three differ, and the binding computes the value itself wherever it knows
the format -- which is both constructors and FromStream. A CNA that changed
either route fails here rather than passing silently, the same treatment
`DepthStencilState''s stencil masks get."

  "What 'invalidated' means observably, read from the two Dispose bodies.

`SoundEffectInstance.Dispose(bool)' sets `disposed', tells its effect through
`ChildDestroyed', and deallocates its voice. So after the parent's cascade the
instance is disposed in exactly the sense a directly disposed one is, and every
member that opens with an `IsDisposed' test throws `ObjectDisposedException' --
`State', the transport, `Apply3D' and the three settings' setters.

**The four settings are the exception, and the IL is why**: `get_Volume',
`get_Pitch', `get_Pan' and `get_IsLooped' are each a seven-byte `ldfld' with no
disposal test, so they answer the last value stored. They are managed slots here
for that reason and this test is where the difference is visible -- it used to
assert the opposite, that all four refused, and called that a divergence in its
own comment while the compatibility report went on calling the members complete.

Disposing the instance again afterwards is legal and does nothing, because
`Dispose(bool)' returns early when `IsDisposed' is already true."

quietly.

Answering a disposed instance is only correct if the answer was correct while it
was alive, so this reads both sides: the public getter, and
`cna_sound_effect_instance_get_info' through the private macro. They must agree
on a fresh instance -- at XNA's constructor defaults, 1, 0, 0 and false -- and
after each setter.

**APPLY-3D is where they are allowed to part, and only there.** XNA's
`UnsafeApply3D' stores `is3d' and `listenerData' and nothing else; CNA's mixer
recomputes pan and pitch from the emitter's position and reports those through
`get_info'. So after a positioning the public `PAN' must still be the value the
caller assigned. This asserts that it is, and does not assert what CNA's number
became -- that is the mixer's business and pinning it would be pinning CNA's
spatial arithmetic to this test."

number means, and it is the reason this member is worth a lane of its own: the
count \"only shrinks once a buffer has actually been **consumed by playback**, not
merely handed to the mixer, which is the canonical contract\". So the fall is a
statement about the native streaming state machine rather than about this
binding.

The assertion is a state transition, not a duration:

    pending = 0
    submit half a second of generated PCM16   -> pending = 1
    submit a second block                     -> pending = 2
    play, and run frames                      -> pending falls to 0

Half a second rather than a few frames' worth, so that the rise cannot be raced
by the fall -- and the fall is polled with a **bound** rather than asserted at a
frame count, because how many frames half a second of audio takes depends on the
frame rate and on nothing this test controls. Nothing here claims a sound was

**No FiveAM assertion runs inside the callback.** The handler records what it

callback test here follows: a condition signalled inside a C callback would cross
the containment layer rather than fail the test.

What is asserted:

  * the handler is called, with the **instance** as its sender -- XNA's
    `OnBufferNeeded' invokes `handler(this, EventArgs.Empty)', and the empty
    argument is not projected;
  * removing it stops the calls, and removing it twice answers NIL rather than
    refusing, which is what `-=' against a delegate that no longer holds it does;
  * the callback registry returns to the size it was, so no token is left rooted;
  * **no callback arrives after disposal**, which is XNA's own ordering: its
    `Dispose(bool)' removes the instance from the table its native callback looks
    it up in before the base disposal deallocates the voice.

`CNA_AudioEventCallback` returns **void**, exactly as `CNA_GameEventCallback`
does, so there is no result code and no diagnostic structure to report a failure
through. The condition is therefore contained inside the callback, the frame
completes, and the **frame call itself re-signals it** once control is back in
Lisp -- the original condition object, not a description of it.

**This test used to assert the opposite**, that the condition was contained and
then lost, and called the loss \"the documented limit\", while the public
docstring on ADD-BUFFER-NEEDED-HANDLER promised a re-signal. Both could not be
true: CALL-NATIVE-FRAME cleared the pending condition unread on every successful
call. src/internal/callback-conditions.lisp is the mechanism that makes the
docstring's version the true one.

What would fail without containment is not an assertion but the process: a Lisp
condition unwinding through a C frame is undefined behaviour, and the game would
not shut down afterwards. So the two halves are separate claims -- the frame
