parameter holds a Texture2D and a TextureCube at once and each getter answers its
own. And CNA's *base* identity -- the one that looks like the natural home for
XNA's single `SetValue(Texture)' -- is write-only: the header says no native
getter corresponds to it, and a texture put there is readable through neither
typed getter.

That is why the setter routes by the argument's runtime type. XNA does no such
thing: its one `SetValue' calls one D3D `SetTexture' and the kind-specific getters
QueryInterface the result. Routing everything to CNA's base identity would be the
closer transcription of XNA and would silently lose every texture.
