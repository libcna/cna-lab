;;;; microphone.lisp --- the Microphone closure against a real CNA C ABI library.
;;;;
;;;; **Nothing here is a claim that a microphone heard anything.** No assertion
;;;; below inspects a captured byte: what is asserted is *enumeration, object
;;;; identity, state, buffer arithmetic and event semantics* over whatever stream
;;;; the device produces. `docs/qualification.md' names the evidence levels;
;;;; audible correctness is not among them and no assertion below implies it.
;;;;
;;;; **Which device produces that stream is the driver's business and this file
;;;; does not choose one.** `tools/qualification/microphone.sh' does -- it runs
;;;; the suite under `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy', whose capture devices produce
;;;; silence, and under a driver that does not exist -- and it is where the
;;;; strongest supportable sentence is written out in full. A developer's machine
;;;; running the suite directly may have real capture hardware; that changes
;;;; which device answered and changes none of the assertions.
;;;;
;;;; **Two branches and both assert.** This is the rule the audio and rasterizer
;;;; lanes already follow, and for the same reason: a lane that cannot fail for
;;;; the right reason proves nothing.
;;;;
;;;;   capture devices enumerated   MICROPHONE_ENUMERATION and the four lanes
;;;;                                below it are asserted
;;;;   none enumerated              **MICROPHONE_UNAVAILABLE**: `MICROPHONE-ALL'
;;;;                                must answer the empty list and
;;;;                                `MICROPHONE-DEFAULT' must answer NIL, and
;;;;                                they do
;;;;
;;;; Neither branch is a skip. `audio.h' calls a count of zero "an ordinary
;;;; answer", so the no-device branch is a *result* rather than a missing test,
;;;; and `SDL_AUDIODRIVER' chooses which branch runs deterministically and with
;;;; no hardware on either side.
;;;;
;;;; **The device's own numbers are read, not assumed.** The qualification
;;;; environment's dummy devices report 44100 Hz, and no assertion below is
;;;; written against 44100: every arithmetic expectation is computed from
;;;; `SAMPLE-RATE' as the microphone reports it, so the tests measure XNA's
;;;; arithmetic rather than one machine's device. The one place a literal appears
;;;; is beside a computed expectation, to show the reader what the numbers are on
;;;; the reference runtime.

  :capture-data           `GET-DATA' wrote captured PCM16 into exactly the range
                          it reported and advanced at the reported sample rate
  :capture-idle           devices enumerated and the state machine transitioned,
                          but this environment's driver delivered no PCM at all --

`MicrophoneCollection.OnBufferReady(handle)' walks its own list for the element

the object `All' and `Default' hand out. A projection that built a fresh facade
from the device index inside the callback would deliver an object with equal
slots and the wrong identity, which is exactly what `EQ' catches here.

The buffer duration is set low on purpose: CNA raises the event once the unread
backlog reaches `BufferDuration', so a 100 ms buffer makes it due within a few
frames. **No event count is asserted** -- neither framework publishes a rate, and
CNA raises it on every buffer check until `GET-DATA' drains the backlog."

**This is not an invention; it is what the IL does.** `Name', `SampleRate',
`IsHeadset' and `BufferDuration' are fields XNA's getters read, so they keep
answering -- there is nothing native to reach. `State' calls the device on every
read, so it needs an active game and refuses without one, with the established
projection-limit condition.

The identity question is answered by measurement rather than assumed: CNA's
device list is owned by the runtime and is identical across a game being
destroyed and another created -- same count, same names, same rates -- so the
cache is process-global and the same facade is still the right object. What is

  "Enumeration is several native queries per device, and any of them can fail.

A microphone has no owned handle, so there is nothing to give back -- but the
**cache** can still be corrupted, and in a worse way than a leaked handle: it is
process-global and append-only, so a snapshot published with three of five
devices in it would be a snapshot the *next* successful enumeration never fills
in, because it starts from the cached count. The device at index three would
become unreachable for the life of the process.

So %ENUMERATE-MICROPHONES builds every new facade into a fresh list and appends it
in one assignment. This asserts that: a failure part way through leaves the cache
exactly as it was, the original condition reaches the caller, and the next
enumeration -- with the fault removed -- produces the full set.

**The fault is injected by redefining a private reader**, which is invasive and
is the only way to reach this: the failure is a native query failing, and the
qualification's devices do not fail. The original definition is restored however
the test ends."
