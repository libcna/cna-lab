;;;; graphics-adapter.lisp --- GraphicsAdapter and DisplayModeCollection.
;;;;
;;;; Every one of these runs **inside a callback**, and that is the type's whole
;;;; story: CNA has no adapter query that does not take a graphics-device handle,
;;;; so the two members XNA makes static -- Adapters and DefaultAdapter -- need a
;;;; live game and a lifecycle method to be inside. They are reported partial for
;;;; that, and the test that they refuse *outside* one is as much a part of the
;;;; evidence as the values.
