;;;; owned-graphics-device.lisp --- the GraphicsDevice a caller constructs.
;;;;
;;;; **What these lanes are for is proving there are two native ownership worlds
;;;; under one public type**, and that neither has leaked into the other. The
;;;; easy wrong implementation is a second class, or a first class that quietly
;;;; reaches for the active game whenever it needs something; both would pass a
;;;; test that only checked the constructor returns an object.
;;;;
;;;; Everything asserted here about CNA was measured first, through the C ABI
;;;; alone, by `tools/qualification/owned-device-matrix.sh'. Two of those
;;;; measurements contradict the ABI header's own prose, and both are asserted
;;;; in **both** directions so that a CNA which changed would fail a test rather
;;;; than silently changing this binding:
;;;;
;;;;   * the header says cross-device resource use "is refused"; it is not, in
;;;;     any direction, on any admitted ABI. This binding refuses it itself.
;;;;   * the header says a caller-created device's resources "are released with
;;;;     it"; they are, and the handle-table entry outlives them, so a second
;;;;     destroy is tolerated and inert.

;;; --- OWNED_DEVICE_CROSS_DEVICE ------------------------------------------------
;;;
;;; **The ABI header says cross-device use is refused and it is not**, and the
;;; honest thing to do about that is not to invent the refusal. Two authorities
;;; were read:
;;;
;;;   * CNA, measured -- `set_texture(B, PIXEL, 0, A's texture)' answers SUCCESS
;;;     and reading B's slot back reports `bound' with A's texture handle in it,
;;;     on all three admitted ABIs, both renderers and in every direction:
;;;     owned into owned, owned into a Game's, a Game's into owned.
;;;
;;;   * XNA, read from the pinned assembly -- `TextureCollection::set_Item'
;;;     guards disposal, the active render target, the profile's vertex-texture
;;;     formats and the slot index, and **compares no devices at all**. Nothing
;;;     anywhere in the assembly compares a `GraphicsResource::_parent' against
;;;     the device it is being bound to; the 112 reads of that field are
;;;     `get_GraphicsDevice', `ToString' and the resource manager.
;;;
;;; So a refusal here would be a member this projection gained, which is the one
;;; thing it may never do.
;;;
;;; **And measuring it turned up something the header does not mention at all:
;;; CNA's sampler slot table is shared between devices rather than per device.**
;;; Bind A's texture into A slot 0, then B's into B slot 0, and A's slot 0 then
;;; reports `bound' with an *invalid* handle -- CNA's way of saying "something
;;; is here and no C resource owns it". In XNA each device has its own
;;; `TextureCollection' over its own device state and neither would disturb the
