;;;; graphics-state.lisp --- the state objects against the real CNA C ABI.
;;;;
;;;; HEADLESS proves the descriptors were accepted, that the device round-trips
;;;; them, and that the state-bearing SpriteBatch.Begin shapes reach CNA. It
;;;; proves nothing about blending, culling, filtering or any other pixel-
;;;; producing behaviour, and nothing here claims otherwise.
;;;;
;;;; The cross-checks against CNA's own presets are the point of the file. XNA is
;;;; the authority for what a BlendState *is*; CNA has presets of its own, and
;;;; where the two differ the divergence is proved here rather than assumed away.
