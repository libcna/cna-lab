;;;; game-device-events.lisp --- Game's private device-event wiring, against a
;;;; real CNA runtime.
;;;;
;;;; **This whole file is about a member that does not exist.** `Game' subscribes
;;;; to `IGraphicsDeviceService' from the private `HookDeviceEvents', and none of
;;;; the four handlers it installs is a public XNA member -- so nothing here moves
;;;; a compatibility cell, and the lane exists because a lifecycle invariant with
;;;; no scoreboard row is still a lifecycle invariant. Before this wiring existed,
;;;; a game whose graphics device was disposed kept every asset its content
;;;; manager had loaded, and no test in the repository could tell.
;;;;
;;;; The claims are kept apart for the reason the services, storage and
;;;; owned-device lanes keep theirs apart. That the private handler *runs* says
;;;; nothing about whether it read the **current** `Game.Content'; that it read
;;;; the current one says nothing about whether a real loaded asset actually
;;;; reached its disposed state; and none of those says anything about what
;;;; happens when an asset's disposal signals inside a callback that arrived
;;;; through C.

Installing them adds a managed listener and, for the first event kind, a native

teardown could not reach.

Three claims, and they are three: the condition reaches Lisp rather than
unwinding through the C frame that called `Initialize`; the game can still be
destroyed; and after its disposal it holds no listener. The last is what
`UnhookDeviceEvents` is for, and it has to work on the failure path too."
