# owned-device-matrix.sh --- measure the caller-created GraphicsDevice, one stage per process.
#
# `graphics_device.h' is byte-identical across ABI 0.21.0, 0.22.0 and 0.23.0 --
# `md5sum' says so -- and Storage already proved what that is worth. So every
# claim CNA-Lisp makes about a caller-created device is measured here, through
# the C ABI alone with no binding in the path.
#
#   owned-device-matrix.sh <library> [<library> ...]
#
# Each stage runs in its own process, so a stage that faults names itself and
# does not take the others with it. The output is the evidence; nothing in it is
# asserted here, because what CNA does is what this script is for finding out.
