# Isolated consumer qualification.

# Build a deterministic source artifact of CNA-Lisp, extract it somewhere clean,
# and run the template against *that* -- with a source registry that names the
# artifact and the template and nothing else, and a fresh FASL cache.
#
# The point is what it rules out. A canary that passes because ASDF quietly found
# the developer's working tree, or an old FASL, or a globally installed copy,
# proves nothing about the artifact. So this script checks where CNA-Lisp was
# actually loaded from and fails if the answer is not the extraction directory.
#
# It also checks the three pixels the template reads, in both directions: under a
# rasterising renderer they must be the exact colours the template drew, and under
# one with no readback they must all say so. Printing them was not enough -- a
# consumer that had quietly stopped drawing would have printed whatever it found.
