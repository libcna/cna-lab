# Qualify Texture3D volume storage on a renderer that claims the capability.
#
#   tools/qualification/texture3d-matrix.sh /path/to/libcna_c_api.so ...
#
# **Why this is a script of its own.** `texture3d-support-probe' answered one
# question -- can this library create a Texture3D -- and on HEADLESS and SOFTWARE
# the answer is `CNA_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED' on every admitted ABI. That is a true
# answer about those two renderers and was read as an answer about CNA. EasyGL
# advertises `GraphicsCapability::Texture3D' on every non-ES2 GL profile, so the
# capability has to be measured against a build that claims it, on a software GL
# stack a CI machine can reproduce.
#
# Each stage runs in its **own process**, for two reasons that both cost a
# measurement here:
#
#   * a stage that faults must name itself rather than take the rest with it, and
#   * EasyGL cannot create a GraphicsDevice once the **last** one has been
#     destroyed -- `cna_graphics_device_create' segfaults across such a gap,
#     because the video subsystem comes down with the last device and does not go
#     back up. It is *not* limited to one device at a time: the `overlap' stage
#     creates and destroys four devices beside one that stays alive and every one
#     of them works. HEADLESS and SOFTWARE survive the gap too, so this is the
#     renderer's and not the ABI's. The `churn' stage keeps saying so and is the
#     one stage expected to fail.
#
# The GL stack is Xvfb plus Mesa's llvmpipe, forced with `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE'.
# The point of the lane is that volume storage works on a *deterministic software
# implementation*, so a physical GPU is never a prerequisite; if one is present it
# is deliberately not used.
