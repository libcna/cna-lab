# owned-graphics-device.sh --- the caller-owned GraphicsDevice, in its own lanes.
#
# A seventh script beside audio, microphone, media, storage, services and the
# rasterizer, and for a reason of its own: **this is the only graphics surface in
# the repository that needs no `GAME'**, and the whole point of it would be lost
# if it were qualified inside a run that has one. The suite exercises it too --
# `tests/native/owned-graphics-device.lisp' -- but a suite run has games in it,
# so a lane that proves "no game is needed" has to be a process with no game.
#
#   OWNED_DEVICE_SUITE     the whole test system with all of the owned-device
#                          evidence required by name: the constructor, two
#                          coexisting devices, a game and an owned device side
#                          by side, resources reporting their actual device,
#                          cross-device use, the shared sampler slots, disposal,
#                          the Disposing event and construction atomicity.
#
#   OWNED_DEVICE_CONSUMER  the public-only consumer, audited mechanically for
#                          any reach into the internal package, CFFI, a handle,
#                          a result code or a private `%'-symbol -- and, the
#                          claim only this consumer and the storage one make,
#                          **for constructing no `GAME'**.
#
# The pixel claim depends on the renderer and the script says which it got.
# HEADLESS proves lifecycle and command submission and nothing about pixels;
# SOFTWARE -- a CPU rasteriser needing no display -- proves pixels. A run that
# took the no-readback branch says so rather than letting the reader assume.
#
#   CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY=/abs/path/libcna_c_api.so \
#     tools/qualification/owned-graphics-device.sh
#
# **Do not run two copies of this script at once against one checkout.** Both
# write build-probe/owned-device-suite.log, and the branch check below reads it
# back to decide whether this renderer made a pixel claim or a no-readback one --
# so two interleaved runs can leave a log containing both and fail with "the run
# produced both a pixel claim and a no-readback result", which is a collision and
# not a result. CI is unaffected: the HEADLESS and SOFTWARE lanes are separate
# jobs with separate checkouts.
