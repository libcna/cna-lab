# Game's private device-event wiring, qualified by kind.
#
# **This lane qualifies a member that does not exist.** `Game::HookDeviceEvents'
# and the four handlers it installs are private in the pinned assembly, so not
# one of them is a row in the compatibility report and no scoreboard number moves
# when they work. The evidence lines below are the only record that the invariant
# holds, which is exactly why each is required by name rather than read out of
# another.
#
#   GAME_DEVICE_HOOK_INSTALLATION
#                       a constructed game had hooked nothing and a game that had
#                       run held **four** private subscriptions, on the same
#                       GraphicsDeviceManager object that Game.Services answers
#                       for IGraphicsDeviceService. Not a second event source.
#   GAME_DEVICE_CONTENT_UNLOAD
#                       a real SpriteFont **and the atlas it keeps alive** were
#                       loaded through Game.Content, and both reached their
#                       disposed state -- with the cache and the disposal list
#                       emptied -- when the graphics device manager was disposed.
#                       Not "UNLOAD was called".
#   GAME_DEVICE_CONTENT_CURRENT_REFERENCE
#                       with Game.Content reassigned from A to B, the event
#                       unloaded **B** and left A's font and atlas untouched. A
#                       handler that had closed over the manager it was installed
#                       with passes the line above and fails this one.
#   GAME_DEVICE_EVENT_ORDER
#                       a handler added before Initialize ran first, the
#                       framework's private listener second, and a handler added
#                       after Initialize third. Subscription order in one
#                       multicast list -- not "internal first" chosen because it
#                       sounded safer.
#   GAME_DEVICE_UNLOAD_FAILURE_CONTAINMENT
#                       an asset whose disposal signalled inside the
#                       device-driven unload did not unwind through the C frame,
#                       the later assets were still released, both collections
#                       were still emptied, and the original condition reached
#                       Lisp once.
#   GAME_DEVICE_PRIVATE_SUBSCRIPTION
#                       a program's own add/remove pair left the four private
#                       subscriptions in place, and Game disposal gave them back.
#   GAME_DEVICE_TEARDOWN
#                       the game was destroyed cleanly after the unload.
#   GAME_DEVICE_INSTALLATION_ATOMICITY
#                       a game that installed the four subscriptions and then
#                       failed inside Initialize delivered its condition to Lisp
#                       rather than unwinding through C, was still destroyable,
#                       and held no listener afterwards. The subscriptions are
#                       transactional state -- a managed listener, a native
#                       registration and a callback token that roots the game --
#                       so a game that never became usable must not keep them.
#
# **Nothing here claims Game.UnloadContent is called by this binding.** CNA's
# native game already drives that callback at exactly this point -- measured, and
# recorded in src/runtime/game-device-events.lisp -- so the binding supplies
# `ContentManager.Unload' alone and the pair lands in XNA's order. Calling both
# would run the program's overridable method twice for one device disposal.
#
# **Every admitted ABI is run.** Identical event headers across 0.21.0, 0.22.0
# and 0.23.0 are surface evidence only; the Storage closure established that, and
# this lane behaves accordingly rather than inferring the older two from 0.23.
#
#   tools/qualification/game-device-events.sh
#
# CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY selects a single library instead of the admitted three.

== what this run proved ==
  GAME_DEVICE_HOOK_INSTALLATION          four private subscriptions, installed by
                                         Initialize, on the service object
                                         Game.Services already answers
  GAME_DEVICE_CONTENT_UNLOAD             a real font and its atlas released, and
                                         both collections emptied, by the device
                                         event
  GAME_DEVICE_CONTENT_CURRENT_REFERENCE  the CURRENT Game.Content was the one
                                         unloaded, and the replaced one was left
                                         alone
  GAME_DEVICE_EVENT_ORDER                subscription order, with the framework's
                                         listener where Initialize put it
  GAME_DEVICE_UNLOAD_FAILURE_CONTAINMENT a signalling disposal crossed no C frame
                                         and was delivered once
  GAME_DEVICE_PRIVATE_SUBSCRIPTION       a program's -= cannot remove the
                                         framework's subscription
  GAME_DEVICE_TEARDOWN                   the game still destroyed cleanly

  Not proved, and not claimed: that this binding calls Game.UnloadContent.
  CNA's native game drives that callback itself at the same point, and the
  binding deliberately does not double it. Nor is anything here a claim about
  content *reload* after a later device re-creation: CNA drives no load-content
  for that, XNA's DeviceCreated handler would, and that is a separate hole
  recorded in docs/limitations.md rather than one this lane closes.
