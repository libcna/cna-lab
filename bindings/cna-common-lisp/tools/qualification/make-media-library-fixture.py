"""Generate a deterministic MediaLibrary fixture tree.

CNA's media library scans the platform's user folders, and SDL resolves those
through ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/user-dirs.dirs`` -- CNA's own C-API suite says so in
as many words and builds its fixture the same way.  Pointing that at a generated
tree is what turns "whatever music this machine happens to hold" into a library
with a known count.

    make-media-library-fixture.py <root>

writes::

    <root>/config/user-dirs.dirs      XDG_MUSIC_DIR and XDG_PICTURES_DIR
    <root>/Music/cna-lisp-probe.mp3   one tag-only MP3
    <root>/Music/cna-lisp-probe.wav   one real, decodable WAV
    <root>/Pictures/cna-lisp-mark.png one picture at the root
    <root>/Pictures/Nested/quadrant-4.png  one in a sub-album

and prints the ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` a probe should run with.

**The MP3 carries tags and no audio.**  The index reads a song's title, artist,
album and genre from its ID3 tags, so a frame-only file produces a real song,
album, artist and genre without a recording in the tree.  That is CNA's own
technique, not an invention here.

**The WAV is real and decodable, and it is there for the half the MP3 cannot
cover**: a tag-only MP3 indexes but will not decode, so a library song that is
meant to be *played* needs this one.  It carries no tags, and CNA does not leave
its artist and album empty -- it derives them from the directory names.  Those
derived names are therefore a function of where this fixture lives, so a test may
assert the counts and the *tagged* song's names and must not assert the untagged
song's.  See docs/media-library-audit.md section 3.3.

The expected library, on every admitted ABI:

    songs 2   albums 2   artists 2   genres 1   playlists 0   pictures 2
