    # The dependency-complete SoundEffect closure -- eight types, every type they

    # arguments are an Int32 and the AudioChannels already here, and its one

    # "CNA has no route for any of it", and that was measured false: `xact.h' has
    # 62 routes covering all five reachable types. The real reason is that it
    # could not be *qualified*. `cna_audio_engine_create' takes a path to an

    # --- the Microphone family -------------------------------------------
    # Dependency-complete and measured, not listed: the closure of these three
    # over the snapshot's own `baseType', `interfaces', member return types and
    # parameter types adds **nothing**. Everything they reach is either already
    # selected or the base-class library's -- `System.Byte[]', `System.TimeSpan',
    # `System.Int32', `System.String', `System.Boolean', `System.Exception', and
    # the `ReadOnlyCollection<Microphone>' that `All' answers, which is the same
    # BCL collection wrapper `GraphicsAdapter.Adapters' already projects onto a
    # Common Lisp list.
    #
    # **The reason this family was held back is gone, and it was measured
    # rather than assumed.** It used to read "whose interesting half needs a
    # capture device no verification tree has". SDL's `dummy' audio driver
    # enumerates capture devices that start, stop, and advance a PCM16 stream at
    # their reported sample rate, so both halves qualify deterministically and
    # with no hardware -- the same way `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy' already qualifies
    # the playback half.
    #
    # `MicrophoneCollection' is **not** here and is not a member of this closure:
    # it is `private' in the pinned assembly, so it is not in the 257-type public
    # snapshot at all, and `Microphone.All' answers the BCL wrapper rather than
    # it. The two CNA type-name routes are likewise not members; they answer the
    # microphone type's .NET name, which is machinery, exactly as
    # `cna_game_copy_type_name' is.

    # --- the Model family ------------------------------------------------
    # Dependency-complete and measured rather than listed: the closure of these
    # twelve over the pinned snapshot's own `baseType`, `interfaces`, member
    # return types and parameter types adds **nothing**. Every XNA type they
    # reach -- Effect, Matrix, BoundingSphere, VertexBuffer, IndexBuffer,
    # GraphicsDevice -- was already selected, and everything else they reach is
    # the base-class library's: System.Object, System.String, and the generic
    # collection interfaces `ReadOnlyCollection<T>` carries.
    #
    # **The four nested enumerators are in, and that is what dependency-complete
    # means here.** `ModelBoneCollection.GetEnumerator()` returns
    # `ModelBoneCollection+Enumerator`, an XNA type in this profile rather than
    # a BCL one -- unlike `DisplayModeCollection`'s and the effect collections',
    # whose enumerators are `List<T>.Enumerator` and are therefore outside the
    # selection by the same rule that keeps `System.IO.Stream` out. Selecting
    # the collection and not its enumerator would leave `GetEnumerator()`
    # answering a type the profile does not admit.
    #
    # CNA's own model extensions -- morph targets, the skinned-model EXT family,
    # animation clips, SkinningData, AnimationPlayer, the glTF import report,
    # cameras, skins and material variants -- are **not** here and are not XNA.
    # They share `models.h` with these routes and nothing else; a CNA route is
    # not an argument for a member, which is the rule `cna_sprite_font_create`
    # is already unbound under.

    # `MediaPlayer' and everything it needs to play a song: the one `MediaQueue'
    # it owns, `Song' and `SongCollection', the `MediaState' enumeration and the
    # `VisualizationData' buffer pair.
    #
    # **Three members of `Song' are declared missing so that this is a closure
    # rather than a namespace.** `Song.Artist', `Song.Album' and `Song.Genre'
    # answer `Artist', `Album' and `Genre', which are *media-library* entities:
    # their CNA routes are in `media_library.h' rather than `media.h', and
    # `cna_song_get_album' and its two siblings document that only a song
    # obtained from a media library has one -- a song a caller created from a
    # file path has no library context, so the route reports CNA_FALSE. Measured
    # true on all three admitted ABIs, for the only kind of song this closure can
    # make.
    #
    # Selecting `Album', `AlbumCollection', `Artist' and `Genre' to satisfy those
    # three would add **53 members that nothing in this repository could
    # exercise**, which is the reason `MediaLibrary' was not the closure chosen.
    # They are declared missing under DEPENDENCY_NOT_SELECTED instead -- exactly
    # what `EffectParameter.GetValueTexture3D' is declared under for `Texture3D',
    # which is the standing precedent for a member whose type is not selected.
    #
    # **The library half joined on 2026-09-08, and the reason it was absent is
    # the reason it is here now.** It used to say that `media_library.h' calls an
    # empty library an ordinary result, so CI could qualify *empty* and nothing
    # else. That was measuring the wrong thing: SDL resolves the user folders
    # through `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/user-dirs.dirs', so pointing that at a generated
    # fixture makes the library deterministic and non-empty on every admitted
    # ABI -- songs 2, albums 2, artists 2, genres 1, pictures 2, measured three
    # times each. docs/media-library-audit.md has the whole audit.
    #
    # The music half is selected first and the picture half with it, because
    # `MediaLibrary' itself returns `PictureCollection' and `PictureAlbum' from
    # six of its own members: a closure that stopped at the music half would make
    # `MediaLibrary' partial by construction rather than by any limit.

    # --- Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage -----------------------------------
    # All three types of the namespace, and the closure is complete: everything
    # they reach beyond each other is the base-class library's -- `System.String',
    # `System.Int64', `System.Boolean', `System.String[]', `System.Exception', and
    # the four types the two design questions are about: `System.IAsyncResult',
    # `System.AsyncCallback', `System.IO.Stream' and the three `System.IO' file
    # enumerations. `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.PlayerIndex' is the one XNA type they
    # reach and it has been selected since Foundation 1.
    #
    # The two questions are answered in `docs/limitations.md' and the answers are
    # both "project it the way the pinned IL says, and invent nothing":
    # `IAsyncResult' becomes an opaque already-complete object because XNA's own
    # is already complete, and `System.IO.Stream' becomes a real Common Lisp
    # stream because that is what this binding has always said it becomes.
    # --- game services and device selection --------------------------------
    # **Five types, 21 members, and the count is the contract's rather than the
    # planning pass's.** The plan that recommended this closure counted 17
    # members over five types, with `FrameworkDispatcher' in the list and
    # `IGraphicsDeviceService' absent. The dependency closure over the pinned
    # snapshot says otherwise, and it was recomputed rather than trusted:
    #
    # * `Graphics.IGraphicsDeviceService' is **not optional**. The already
    #   selected `GraphicsDeviceManager' names it in its own `interfaces', beside
    #   `IGraphicsDeviceManager' and `System.IDisposable', so the closure of the
    #   selection *as it already stood* reached it. It was a hole in the profile
    #   before this closure and is filled by it.
    # * `FrameworkDispatcher' is **not reached by anything**. Nothing in the
    #   257-type snapshot names it in a base type, an interface, a return type or
    #   a parameter type -- it is a static pump a program calls itself. It is not
    #   selected here, because `cna_framework_dispatcher_update' existing is not
    #   an argument for a member: that is the rule `cna_sprite_font_create' is
    #   already unbound under, and the rule CNA's own model extensions are
    #   excluded by.
    #
    # Adding these five reaches **no** further unselected type: `Adapter',
    # `GraphicsProfile' and `PresentationParameters' are all already here, and
    # everything else the five touch is the base-class library's --
    # `System.Type', `System.Object', `System.IServiceProvider', `System.EventArgs',
    # `System.EventHandler`1' and the `List<GraphicsDeviceInformation>' that
    # `RankDevices' takes.
    #
    # **None of those BCL types is added to the profile**, and each collapses the
    # way this binding already collapses its kind. `System.Type' becomes a service
    # type designator -- a class or a declared protocol -- rather than CLR
    # reflection; `System.IServiceProvider' becomes the one generic function
    # `GET-SERVICE', the way `System.IAsyncResult' became an opaque object and
    # `System.IO.Stream' became a Common Lisp stream; `List<T>' becomes an
    # ordinary mutable Lisp sequence, as every other generic collection here does;
    # and `System.EventArgs' stays collapsed, as it has been since `Game''s four
    # events. `docs/common-lisp-mapping.md' carries all four rules.
