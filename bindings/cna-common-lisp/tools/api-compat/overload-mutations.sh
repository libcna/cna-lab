# Overload-shape mutation self-test.
#
# A family of XNA overloads collapsed onto one Lisp function has to declare how
# each overload is told from its siblings, and the verifier has to be able to
# call a declaration a lie. This mutates the rules ten ways and requires a
# wrong_overload_shape diagnostic each time, mutates the contract once and
# requires a refusal, and then requires a clean run.
#
# The fifth is not about overloads at all but belongs with them: two members
# sharing a signature key is how an overload goes unmeasured, and the count is the
# only thing that notices.
#
# Steps 5 to 7 exist because declaring a mechanism is not the same as being
# separated by it: two overloads can both say "keywords" and list the same
# ones, which is how SpriteBatch.Draw's two scale overloads and
# GraphicsDevice's two index widths sat side by side telling nobody what
# actually distinguishes them. Steps 8 to 10 exist because sometimes nothing
# does -- MeasureString(String) and MeasureString(StringBuilder) are one call
# -- and that has to be a checked claim rather than a silence.
#
# The tagged-argument steps exist because of the mechanism EffectParameter
# needed. Its eighteen SetValue overloads differ only in the value's type; Lisp
# has no overloading to dispatch on that, so the projection takes the type as an
# argument and the rules declare "tagged-argument". A mechanism like that is
# worth nothing unless declaring it *wrongly* is caught -- naming no tag, or
# giving two overloads the same tag, which would make them the same call.
