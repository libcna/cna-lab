    separate the overloads: that no two of them collapse onto one symbol with
    nothing left to tell them apart. It does **not** prove that the running
    function accepts only the declared keyword sets, and it must not be described
    as if it did. The distinction cost a real defect: `SoundEffect.Play''s two
    declarations were correct and different while the method accepted six shapes
    neither of them describes, because a `&key' lambda list makes every keyword
    optional and fills the rest in with defaults.

    Enforcing that is the runtime's job and `%CHECK-OVERLOAD-KEYWORDS' in
    `src/framework/overloads.lisp' is where it happens. Reproducing it here would
    mean interpreting Lisp inside this script, which is the wrong place for it.

    Three ways, and each is a declaration rather than a silence:

    * the declared mechanism separates them -- distinct keys;
    * a `discriminator' does, when the mechanism does not: an argument whose
      Lisp *type* selects the overload, which is what an index array's element
      type and a scale's realness do. Every overload in the partition must name
      the same argument, and their types must differ -- one of them declaring it
      would only have hidden the collision;
    * or they declare `unified_with', naming exactly the siblings they cannot be
      told from, and why that is right. `MeasureString(String)' and
      `MeasureString(StringBuilder)' are the honest case: after XNA's own private
      StringProxy the two method bodies are identical, a StringBuilder is reached
      only through Length and Chars, and one Common Lisp string expresses both.

    An undeclared collision is the dishonest case, and is what this refuses.

    """Verify one CLR event against its declared projection.

    A CLR event is two operations, `add_E` and `remove_E`, and the projection is
    two generic functions on the object that raises it. The rule must name both;
    an event with no rule is missing, and an event whose rule names a symbol that
    is not a generic function is an `event_mapping_mismatch` -- because a plain
    function could not be specialised on a second type that raises the same
    event, and `Disposed` is raised by two of them.

    **A *static* event is the exception, and the contract says which ones those
    are.** `MediaPlayer.ActiveSongChanged` and `MediaPlayer.MediaStateChanged`
    are static: XNA keeps their delegates in static fields and raises them with
    `handler(null, args)`, because there is no instance to be the sender. So
    there is no object to specialise on, and requiring a generic function would
    be requiring a generic function with nothing to dispatch on -- which is
    weaker than a plain function, not stronger, because it would accept a method
    on `T` that any object could reach. Static events therefore project onto
    plain functions of one argument, and the `static` flag that permits it is
    read from the **contract**, never from the rule, so a rule cannot claim it.

    **An event may declare a `package`, and one that does is checked there.**
    `IGraphicsDeviceService` is the reason: its four events are the *same* pairs
    `GraphicsDeviceManager` already exposes, and the manager lives in
    `Microsoft.Xna.Framework` while the interface lives in
    `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics`. Defining a second pair in the graphics
    package to satisfy a namespace would create exactly the duplicate event state
    that projecting the interface onto the same object exists to avoid. This is
    the same escape `member_overrides` already has, and it is checked rather than
    assumed: the symbol must exist and be exported from the package the rule
    names, and it is claimed there, so a rule cannot point at a package to make
    an absence disappear.
